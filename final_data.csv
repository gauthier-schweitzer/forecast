  <https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.16.2/>

This is a new minor version release, with various bugfixes
as well as updated translations.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at GitHub:

  <https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues>

To receive security and update notifications, please subscribe to:

  <https://bitcoincore.org/en/list/announcements/join/>

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt` (on Mac)
or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).

The first time you run version 0.15.0 or newer, your chainstate database will be converted to a
new format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour,
depending on the speed of your machine.

Note that the block database format also changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no
automatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0 or higher. Upgrading
directly from 0.7.x and earlier without re-downloading the blockchain is not supported.
However, as usual, old wallet versions are still supported.

Downgrading warning
-------------------

Wallets created in 0.16 and later are not compatible with versions prior to 0.16
and will not work if you try to use newly created wallets in older versions. Existing
wallets that were created with older versions are not affected by this.

Compatibility
==============

Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.

Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
frequently tested on them.

is that a cold storage wallet? How long is the blockchain synchronization going on?

The initial synchronization usually takes about 3 days. It depends on the number of connections to other nodes and your computer processing power (each block must be verified). Bitcoin Core is a software wallet which is a great choice if you don't want to buy a hardware wallet or use a paper wallet which is less convenient. Electrum is a popular alternative since you don't have to synchronize with the whole network. However, you have to depend on an external server in that case."

You'd better hope not because that would be the beginning of the end.

For something like a note to exist, that requires a third party to create it, fund it and claim that it's the real deal. Then everyone else has to choose to believe them. There would be practical no way of telling whether it was compromised, infinitely duplicated or plain fictional.

So that's pretty much everything Bitcoin was invented to stop."

Bitcoin only really exists and proves its effectiveness when in the form of data as it is now. That made Bitcoin a remarkable alternative to paper money. Bitcoin should not become paper money because it is the real end to this electronic currency. It should be further developed in the form of data instead of being converted into paper money."

Physical Bitcoins can exist. Take a look at these physical Bitcoins created by the Bitcointalk user Casacious:

https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Casascius_physical_bitcoins

Not only do they exist, they are actually a collector's items now! I myself would love to own a legitimate Casacious coin!

As long as the Bitcoin can physically be stored in a (nearly) 100% tamperproof way, Bitcoin can exist as physical money. Casacious coins aren't even the only example of physical Bitcoins, as there are also notes out there (can't seem to remember their names), and Lealana coins as well."

Bitcoin balances are stored in a large distributed network, and they cannot be fraudulently altered by anybody.

Even if bitcoin can indeed change its form, which I doubt it to be possible, it would be like a downgrade in technology. We see have all sorts of currency in paper. If bitcoin were to join in it in their ranks, it would be redundant.
So surely bitcoin will not and should never change its form as it will degrade in stead of upgrading."

I think no isn't. Because bitcoin was developed as virtual means of payment as the credit cards and online banking networks people use everyday. Bitcoin balances are stored in a large distributed network, and they cannot be fraudulently altered by anybody. In other words, Bitcoin users have exclusive control over their funds and bitcoins cannot vanish just because they are virtual.
Yup. If its physical currency is made it will kill the virtual aspect and decentralization of bitcoin which was the actual reason of its birth."

You'd better hope not because that would be the beginning of the end.

For something like a note to exist, that requires a third party to create it, fund it and claim that it's the real deal. Then everyone else has to choose to believe them. There would be practical no way of telling whether it was compromised, infinitely duplicated or plain fictional.

So that's pretty much everything Bitcoin was invented to stop.

Bitcoin can't change its form. it's a decentralized digital currency having no central issuer. More so, the value is not stable and it's very volatile, should it have a paper form, then the value when about to be use must first be check online and necessary conversions made,this of course is not feasible and won't work.

While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Bitcoin. Bitcoins can also be exchanged in physical form such as the Denarium coins, but paying using it as normal paper money is not possible. Transaction can only be done on Blockchain. I think it will only be in this form because Blockchain is most secure bank we have where thief will not break through unless you gave out your security information.

Of course there is. The possibility of bitcoin to be accepted as cash will rely on the adoption of merchants all over the world. Who would have thought that one can nearly pay for virtually anything using paypal? It would nearly be the same case for bitcoin.

Will it be possible for the future projects in blockchain and for bitcoin to involve Artificial Intelligence in its working for increased efficiency? And will the use of AI be even useful or possible?
Yes why not? AI is the most efficient technology of the present and so is the bitcoin. We can transform the blockchain network by implementing AI and it will have power beyond imagination. 
But AI is the very new technology and implementing it can hold its threats. We do not even know the limits to AI. What if it only degrades blockchain network and bitcoin?
What kind of AI implementation that can degrade the Blockchain network? that risk will occur if you connect AI with the network, but how will you connect the AI and Blockchain networks?, and what are the benefits? please give a sample case so I can imagine it"

By definition artificial intelligence is something that keeps evolving based on single algorithm and mathematically expression.

167;2018-09-12 10:00:25;Digixhub;Newbie;19;1;"First, let us get a brief idea about what is AI and Blockchain.
 
AI refers to Artificial Intelligence, which is also called Machine Intelligence (MI). AI is intelligence demonstrated by machine in contrast to Natural Intelligence (NI) which is seen in humans and animals.
The term artificial intelligence is applied when a machine copies “cognitive” functions that human relate with other humans mind, such as “learning” and “solving problems”.
 
From the functions of speech-pattern recognition to self-driving cars, AIs’ goal is to learn and apply knowledge that is extracted from a large amount of data to make them more intelligent.
According to Don & Alex Tapscott, authors Blockchain Revolution,“The blockchain is an incorruptible digital ledger of economic transactions that can be programmed to record not just financial transactions but virtually everything of value.”
Blockchains’ main features consist of transparency, security, and authentication. Wherein the records are transparent and visible publicly, it is secure as the data is immutable or incorruptible and authenticity refers to the verification process of the user’s identity.
 
HOW CAN AI COVER BLOCKCHAINS FLAWS?
 
The blockchain is concerned with keeping correct data, authentication, and execution. Even though Blockchain is powerful it has its own limitations. Some of which are technical and others are inherited from the old minded culture of the financial services sector. The few things in which AI can cover up blockchains flaws are:
 
1. Energy consumption
One of the terms in blockchain is mining. Mining is a tough job and consumes a huge amount of energy to complete the task. In optimizing energy consumption, AI has proven to be very efficient. If we see that efficiency, it can even help the blockchain in optimizing the energy. This would help in lower investment in mining hardware.
 
2. Security
The blockchain is next to impossible to hack, however, as we go deeper, the layers and applications are not that secure.  AI has been progressing at a good pace from last two years. AI can be of help to blockchain to guarantee a secure application deployment, mainly given the fixed structure of the system.
 
3. Efficiency
In 2016, Deloitte estimated a total cost of $600 million for validating and sharing transactions on the blockchain.  An intelligent system might be of assistance here. It can compute on the fly the likelihood for particular nodes to be the first performing a certain task and informing the other miners to shut down efforts for the certain transaction and eventually cut down on total cost.
 
HOW CAN BLOCKCHAIN COVER UP AI’s FLAWS
 
1. Can Help AI to Explain Itself
AI black-box suffers from explainability problem. it cannot explain itself. Having a clear trail will increase the trustworthiness of the data and the models. It will also help to trace the machines decision-making process. So, if you are not convinced about any decision is taken by the machine you can have a look at the process yourself and evaluate it.
 
2. Increase AI effectiveness:
AI works better when it has more data to analyze. So, a secure data sharing means more data, which means more models, more models result in better actions – better results and better new data. The network effect is all that matter at the end of the day.
 
3. Reduce catastrophic risks scenario
An AI coded in a DAO with specific smart contracts will be able to only perform those actions, and nothing more. There won’t be additional actions taken,  whatever is specified will be brought into action.

Yes, this is definitely possible. The blockchain can be used in artificial intelligence apps for entering the data into the systems and obtaining the results. This will guarantee the accuracy of data. Blockchain can also establish a marketplace for AI systems. The blockchain technology can eliminate the barriers to entry in this field for the small scale players by reducing the competitive advantage available to technological giants."

In fact, recent studies shown that AI and blockchain can be an outstanding partner.  With the blockchain's immutability, decentralization and transparency, AI can be utilized much much better.

With the aforementioned attributes of blockchain, AI can be more efficient and reliable as it is basing its acquired knowledge from a set of data that does not change (immutability). Then the decentralization will allow access to AIs to virtually everything on the blockchain without restrictions (transparency). And of course AI will always have the data it needs since data is widely available (and remains the same all through out irrespective of its origin)  since no one has central control over these data (decentralization)."

Where the official link or statement from Rolls Royce that they’re set to accept BTC as payment for their cars?

Title: You Can Use Bitcoin to Buy a New Rolls-Royce in Houston
Link: https://www.thestreet.com/investing/you-can-use-bitcoin-to-buy-a-new-rolls-royce-in-houston-14703200

So, yeah. Just in Houston. Might not be that much of a big deal compared to if it was Rolls-Royce internationally, but hey. Adoption is adoption no matter how big or small.

Yeah what I thought.
Suppose it’s better than nothing, though. If it was Rolls Royce worldwide then it’s be bullish. This will do nothing for the price in isolation though."

A Rolls-Royce dealership, Post Oak Motors, in Houston, Texas is now accepting Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash in exchange for the vehicle.
Although this is not the first time that this has been done by an automobile company Earlier this year, a California dealership began accepting Bitcoin for Bugatti Chiron and Pagani Huayra purchases. But it is great to see that bitcoins is now one step closer to becoming a legitimate means to purchase goods. This, again should contribute to investor confidence.

Any chance we are gonna see other luxury brands follow the same tracks?

What do you think is more likely -

But before any purchasing you should be informed what dealership is accepting BTC, they have such information on their websites or you can call them on phone/send e-mail and just ask. The way you are described certainly can be a waste of time, and in article is clearly stated :

Along with the recent rise in the use of cryptocurrencies and the US SEC gearing up to provide a verdict on multiple Bitcoin ETFs, here we have a luxury brand opting to transactions using Bitcoin.
A Rolls-Royce dealership, Post Oak Motors, in Houston, Texas is now accepting Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash in exchange for the vehicle.
Although this is not the first time that this has been done by an automobile company Earlier this year, a California dealership began accepting Bitcoin for Bugatti Chiron and Pagani Huayra purchases. But it is great to see that bitcoins is now one step closer to becoming a legitimate means to purchase goods. This, again should contribute to investor confidence.

Any chance we are gonna see other luxury brands follow the same tracks?

This news is most likely not to bring any impact on the market and also not cheer the investors. Obviously the brand value is there but how many people will be buying Rolls Royce using bitcoin?? Probably 1 in the next 5 years or so!!! What impact it will bring??

What we need to see is that Wal-Mart accepting bitcoin. Then only we will see that bitcoin is being used as a currency. Rolls Royce or Lamborghini or Ferrari accepting bitcoin won't help the market in any way. We need Wal-Mart, MacDonald and Spencer's to accept it to see a real change!"

Yeah, this information is very interesting but it is true or not is still something we can not know because there is no evidence or an accurate statement of this, this test is still unverified, trusting only makes us more illusions. I used to be in this situation many times when some news such as kfc and bmw accepted the bitcoin but later, they all denied and claimed this was a lie, the truth that I see is only the big companies do not want to stick to bitcoin"

Here we need a little correction. It would be a great success if Rolls Royce company was directly accepting Bitcoin as a payment for the car purchase. But it is a dealership which is accepting Bitcoin as a payment not the company. By the way this is an old news I have saw a thread for this in past as well.
Even if the company isn't directly accepting it but still it is encouraging for the Bitcoin lovers."

Along with the recent rise in the use of cryptocurrencies and the US SEC gearing up to provide a verdict on multiple Bitcoin ETFs, here we have a luxury brand opting to transactions using Bitcoin.
A Rolls-Royce dealership, Post Oak Motors, in Houston, Texas is now accepting Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash in exchange for the vehicle.
Although this is not the first time that this has been done by an automobile company Earlier this year, a California dealership began accepting Bitcoin for Bugatti Chiron and Pagani Huayra purchases. But it is great to see that bitcoins is now one step closer to becoming a legitimate means to purchase goods. This, again should contribute to investor confidence.

Any chance we are gonna see other luxury brands follow the same tracks?

They're accepting now because they knew the price of bitcoin is already cheap right now , and one day it will go beyond 20k again.

Well, i think the example you give isn't a really good one... Human stupidity is human stupidity wether you're using the traditional banking system or bitcoin.
If you're stupid enough to sign a legally binding timeshare contract, it doesn't matter if you have all your funds in a traditional FIAT bank account or HODL'ing BTC, you'll still be forced to pay up each and every month.

That being said: bitcoin is decentral, there is no central authority, and it's based upon time-tested cryptographic techniques. This means that, if you hold a traditional bank account, a judge can just sign a piece of paper with which the timeshare company can go to your bank and force them to wire your money to their account. In a BTC world, no piece of paper could ever take your BTC behind your back, you'd always have to make a transaction yourself OR you'd have to fork over your private key/seed phrase/HW wallet pin code. That being said: a judge will always have ways to force you to pay your debts... I'd rather pay a timeshare company their dues instead of going to prison.

The big difference lays in de decentralised part: if you use traditional banks, your account details are just a row in a centralised relational database managed by the banking industry. If they get a piece of paper signed by a judge, they can just edit, update or delete your record in their database (with our without your knowledge/aproval).

In the bitcoin world, nobody but you can spend your unspent outputs (unless they have your private keys)."

Exactly. Having complete control over your funds as you do with Bitcoin is obviously a huge advantage over the fiat bank system, but can also be a disadvantage if you are careless with security.

If your credit card gets cloned, or your account gets hacked, chances are your bank will pick up on suspicious activities and lock your account. Even if they don't, you may be able to claim back money that was stolen. If you are careless with your Bitcoin, using weak passwords or brain wallets or something similar, then tough - the funds are gone and there's nothing you can do about it.

Crypto is perfect if you want to be free of the nanny state overseeing all your transactions, but the buck then stops with you - you can't go crying to some higher power when you mess up your security."

Bitcoin is really safe and secure. Paper wallets can be used to store bitcoins offline, which significantly decreases the chances of the cryptocurrency being stolen by hackers or computer viruses."

I think that it's not necessarily safer in terms of the security of your funds per se.

You're probably able to claim compensation from hacks etc. if they do happen with a bank, which means that in most cases you're covered. However, I'd say that a perfectly secured bitcoin wallet is much safer than something like a bank which incur way higher rates of hacks, and fraud, including cheque fraud and credit card fraud.

Think of it this way - would you rather trust a central entity and a central database, or a decentralised system based on cryptography? Probably the latter.

Also this is not taking into account at all the reversibility of normal fiat banking payments, as well as the fact that bitcoin is a much better store of value than fiat. These all add up to give bitcoin the upper edge imho in terms of long term security."

What exactly are you talking about safely? Bitcoin can be safer than banks, especially for high-volume investments. Also, if I make a monetary transaction today, I can transfer money to the other end of the world in maximum 15-20 minutes. Moreover, no matter how much money you have, the transaction fee is fixed. In the future, the spread of bitcoin will increase as it is converted into money or used as a means of payment. Yes, I think it's safer!

I honestly concur with your brilliant piece! The most important thing for bitcoin is adoption. We need more 'real and workable' projects (products and services) around crypto sphere."

Reports have it that bank frauds still continue to happen despite of strict security measures being taken by the banks. Just between January to July 2018, just timeshare fraud alone had 1.155 reported cases. It's when you’re told you can go on a free holiday or get rich by joining an exclusive holiday club or timeshare programme, but you’re eventually forced to pay for it through small print in the contact. That is not to mention other types of fraud like identity theft etc.

This gets me thinking, is it safer to just have bitcoins, or cryptocurrencies for that matter since it's not regulated by banks? What do you think?

Bank fraud and timeshare fraud are two distinct types of fraud. In the case of bank fraud I think of a centralized institution that holds your money (a bank) and the institution or someone in it defrauds you. In that case, bitcoin is arguably superior because nobody can access your bitcoin unless they have your private key. You have much more control, but with that control comes more responsibility for protecting your private key and not losing it.

With timeshare fraud you are essentially being duped by fraudsters into giving them your money. It's kind of like investing in a scam ICO. If you invest your bitcoin into a fraudulent scheme, then arguably ordinary currency is better than bitcoin because you might have insurance or fraud protection (on your credit card for example)."

Well, i think the example you give isn't a really good one... Human stupidity is human stupidity wether you're using the traditional banking system or bitcoin.

Exactly. Having complete control over your funds as you do with Bitcoin is obviously a huge advantage over the fiat bank system, but can also be a disadvantage if you are careless with security.

If your credit card gets cloned, or your account gets hacked, chances are your bank will pick up on suspicious activities and lock your account. Even if they don't, you may be able to claim back money that was stolen. If you are careless with your Bitcoin, using weak passwords or brain wallets or something similar, then tough - the funds are gone and there's nothing you can do about it.

Crypto is perfect if you want to be free of the nanny state overseeing all your transactions, but the buck then stops with you - you can't go crying to some higher power when you mess up your security.

Even if you aren't careless with it, many other websites that are not under your control can scam you. You might try to buy something with bitcoin and get scammed, something that wont happen with paypal for example or your bank for that matter, at least you would have certain legal options. What about exchanges? Once you deposit your coins there you could lose everything even if you used the best passwords. Cryptocurrencies in theory are great but in practice not so much."

in banks the money  that you put is fix but you can only earn a verry little incentives annually ."

Reports have it that bank frauds still continue to happen despite of strict security measures being taken by the banks. Just between January to July 2018, just timeshare fraud alone had 1.155 reported cases. It's when you’re told you can go on a free holiday or get rich by joining an exclusive holiday club or timeshare programme, but you’re eventually forced to pay for it through small print in the contact. That is not to mention other types of fraud like identity theft etc.

In my point of view. In banking your money there is a chances that you lost it because of identity theft, fraud and many more. We can not say that it is also safe to have a bitcoins because you can also lost and be hack inside the internet. Just like in banks there is also a pros and cons of storing bitcoin. There is also a lots of possible reasons to lost bitcoin."

Banking does provide us with much better security because Banking has a system that makes us secure, because Bank verification includes all very personal information. But what I want is that the creation of an application of Blockchain technology in the banking system. This will make the Bank have a much more sophisticated, centralized system and certainly has a very high security standard. Government support is also very important because it can make this system implemented in an economic system in a country."

I do not think so, agreeing that bitcoin can give us many opportunities to double or triple the amount of money we have but this life has two sides, good and bad, bitcoin is similar, it can help our money rise and it can also help our money to disappear.

I don't agree with you. If the number of fraud happing in traditional banking system is let say for example 2 billion dollars, then the one happening in crypto is quadruple. If people thaf have been scammed in crypto related fraud can some out and speak, many people will run away from cryoto.

in my opinion, banks are safer to save money, but in terms of the benefits of investing in bitcoin it will be very profitable, but in terms of security the two are very good."

Banking is well regulated and there is no anonymity. Therefore, the level of accountability required from the players in the banking industry is high which means that financial crimes can be prevented. Cryptocurrency is not regulated and it is anonymous. This makes it easy for criminal to carryout all manner of crimes. Banking is safer.

But there remains a lot of fraudulent activities within the banking sector. It is among the reasons why each country submits to AMLA since the possibility of Money Laundering has not been squashed til date.

Though true, the banking sector has proven over time that they remain to be the safest form of transacting with security checks in place. There still lies plot holes that are taken advantage of for criminal activities just as much as many thinks bitcoin is largely used for the same offending activity.

So i guess in this regard, the safety against criminal activities remain to be nearly the same between banks and bitcoin."

Both have their own specific features. Each one has their benefits and securites. Banking system is so opt to fiats, blockchain technology is so opt for crypto currencies. The invention of crypto is mainly to eradicate banking system and to reduce energy in going out to banks for crypto currencies. Lets not inter link banks into crypto currencies. I would better choose crypto currencies and wallets rather than fiats and banks down the line. I find wallets, exchanges, transaction with blockchain protection are much better than banking systems."

past performance is no indication of the future. This bubble was bigger than the last one and impacted millions of people that just got introduced to crypto. The ""this is normal in crypto"" argument will not work with these people because well... they aren't tech nerds. People want a SAFE place to put their money but this is definitely not crypto.

Bitcoin started around $900-$100 in January 2017 and reach $13,400 in January 2018, we know that was an intense pump, but then corrected sharply.
The market becomes optimism when bitcoin price soar to $8K in 25th July, but in the past week bitcoin dropping from $7300 to $6200 which created another disappointment. Therefore, the best thing for everyone is; do not expect too much for the price to rise up significantly in this year, forget about $20K, be grateful for the current price at $6200. Nevertheless, bitcoin is unstoppable, as long as we believe in this technology better than fiat currency and use bitcoin as a medium of transactions, it just time matter until traditional financial institutions acknowledge bitcoin, even supercars dealership accept bitcoin1.

This is just unreal, I will be happy if it'll run at least 10,000$ And that is very likely. Bear market stubbornly refuses to give up its position, and the bulls are hiding and waiting for a favorable moment. Well, if we see $ 20,000 by the end of next year. At the same time, let's see how Mr. John McAfee will eat part of his body live

This is very interesting, a lot of speculation has sprung up about Bitcoin, where Bitcoin is currently down and it's hard to rise again. but if that happens then Mr. John McAfee will suffer the consequences.

2017 can be said to be the boom year of the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin has reached the highest price of 20k$. All of us have been looking forward to a cryptocurrenc's steady growth in 2018. But the market is constantly falling, many expect it to rise sharply by the end of 2018, But I do not trust,

Bitcoin started around $900-$100 in January 2017 and reach $13,400 in January 2018, we know that was an intense pump, but then corrected sharply.
The market becomes optimism when bitcoin price soar to $8K in 25th July, but in the past week bitcoin dropping from $7300 to $6200 which created another disappointment. Therefore, the best thing for everyone is; do not expect too much for the price to rise up significantly in this year, forget about $20K, be grateful for the current price at $6200. Nevertheless, bitcoin is unstoppable, as long as we believe in this technology better than fiat currency and use bitcoin as a medium of transactions, it just time matter until traditional financial institutions acknowledge bitcoin, even supercars dealership accept bitcoin1.

No this will be too early.Bitcoin is down from a very long time and is unable to recover at that rate which it used to earlier.But yes recently the demand of bitcoin has been rising and the price is also rising.Bitcoin had reached $20000 in 2017 and it was called the bitcoin year.Bitcoin has gained a lot of users over the years and is the topmost cryptocurrency in the market.No other cryptocurrency has the potential and caoability to overtake bitcoin."

But what I always consider is that many people say that history will repeat itself and so will the crypto currency market decline but with some things going to happen in the future the price of crypto currency will rise again. The other side is that every bitcoin price movement is strongly influenced by several factors and the main factor that I know is regulation. Whereas in 2018 there were many regulations from several countries that refused to use crypto currency and this is why I think that the first reason 'history will repeat itself' will never be the same.

Huobi Group has announced a partnership with Singapore’s National Trading Union Congress (NTUC) Learning Hub to launch a joint effort to promote blockchain education via a series of courses focused on the nuts and bolts of blockchain and distributed ledger technology.

According to a press release shared with CCN, the joint venture aims to introduce people with interest in cryptocurrency or financial technology to the core fundamentals of bitcoin and blockchains, intending to exposing them to the practical uses of the world’s premier cryptocurrency.

Catching Up
Research figures indicate that close to half of global top 50 universities already offer cryptocurrency and blockchain courses, a number that looks set to grow as student interest snowballs in spite of the crypto industry downturn. In Q1 2018, the demand for blockchain-related skills increased at an estimated 6000 percent, indicating a long-term shift toward blockchain and DLT-related workplace skill requirements.

As one of the most renowned institutions in Singapore with a reputation for retraining and upskilling professionals to enable them to keep up with the fast evolving global financial ecosystem, NTUC sees the partnership with Huobi as a critical part of its strategy to keep Singapore’s workforce globally competitive. For Huobi, the partnership forms part of an existing initiative announced by founder Leon Li in 2017 to use a proportion of the company’s resources to boost blockchain education efforts and promote real-world use cases for blockchain technology.

Under the partnership framework, a range of seven-hour courses will be offered with a target of furnishing students with a working knowledge of blockchain technology’s most important concepts including basic theory, infrastructure, smart contracts, and how to store and use of cryptocurrencies.

The plan is for future courses to explore how students can practically exploit the potential of bitcoin through crypto market immersion. Students will be exposed to real life trading scenarios to develop their understanding of trading strategies and how the market values bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Off course who would go and trouble themselves with their political career over crypto currencies? But one thing is for sure, they do own crypto currencies in the similar fashion they own black money in the Swiss bank accounts!

One thing however is sure from this, at least crypto currencies will be in the talks for very long time and it wont go down at all until pelicans feed their hunger.

as for their stance, the politicians are known to have unreliable stance against things that are still in grey area meaning not fully regulated nor fully rejected. they don't want to be left in a camp that fails."

Obviously some politicians own crypto. This is absolutely positive for the space, as this will cause good regulation in stead of bans. I like to see bitcoin and crypto in general as one big octopus. It spreads it’s tentacles everywhere and will eventually be so big and widely spread that it can’t be ignored anymore"

when bitcoin adoption grows, people from different parts of society are going to buy bitcoin. it is like saying back in 1990s that even politicians own a personal computer! obviously adoption of computers was similar, at first only a handful of people owned it, then more people joined in and eventually as of today nearly everyone owns a PC.

I have no facts but its possible that some politicians might have secretly invested on Bitcoin and cryptos. Is a double edge sword, other politicians wages war against crypto but behind they have stash huge amount in wallet.

I think not only politicians though, but there might be people lurking here trying to put down bitcoin but at the back side, once the price fall, they secretly accumulating more and they love to spread FUD around so that they can buy more when the price is at a discount.

Yes, I think there is totally nothing wrong if the politicians are just investing their own money into bitcoins from their monthly paychecks, if the government of the country have already granted the crypto-currencies exchanges the legal documents and proper license to operate in that country, it would meant that everyone have their own freedom to invest in that platform as long as they follow the proper requirements set by that exchange."

691;2018-09-09 14:04:45;Layers318;Jr. Member;126;0;I don't doubt the fact that most of the politicians and those occupying governmental positions have invested in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Most of these politicians are aware of the benefits of using cryptocurrency but do not want to announce it to the public because they fear the power cryptocurrency give to the people in terms of owning absolute control over their own transactions without any middle man interruption.

Well there are some politicians who are opportunists and they may have invested in cryptocurrency when they have understand that crypto has a bright future ahead. In my opinion investment in crypto for any of the politician is not something bad or unjust but what makes it grey that they don't talk publicly about crypto. Even if someone is a president, prime minister or a mayor but they should come forward and speak for it. There are rumours of some of the high profile politicians involved in establishing a cryptocurrency exchange in my country and none of them have accepted or denied it till now."

Its a proof that when you invest in bitcoin is safe because even the government has already in investing bitcoin cant you see even the higher Government is in to it,  The ethics guidance means the public will soon learn whether members of Congress are among those who’ve been drawn to what’s become a global investment craze. Bitcoin, the most valuable cryptocurrency, was initially embraced by those who were distrustful of banks and government control over monetary policy. But its meteoric rise last year brought the token to the mainstream and has even made digital coins a focus of congressional hearings."

And why should they not have investment in the cryptocurrency? They have money, you can invest relatively anonymously, the crypto currency has a potential future. Nothing surprising here even if in public they are against the crypto"
758;2018-09-10 15:34:20;burakdat;Jr. Member;238;2;Yeah of course they like to invest here in cryptocurrency. This is one way that their asset and liabilities could be broken down so that their wealth could not be traced. As we all know that digital currency or cryptocurrency could not be declare as an asset in their SALN's.

Nope it is in their face that the politician does not really against in crypto. It is something more than that when they do not really want cryptocurrency to be acknowledge and for that i have speculated that maybe this politicians have invested already on bitcoin and they do not want that their cryptocurrency would be counted on their SALN it could be hard that the government can trace why you have a lots of money on cryptocurrency."

BTC has an extraordinary potential for esteem regarding worth and value volatility of this unit as of late, with its own attributes of financial and mechanical wonders. BTC are worth 10 times their genuine esteem so later on it will probably build significantly more than current costs. We have not so much figured out how to esteem electronic cash units like BTC.

Well its quite possible that some politicians have invested in cryptocurrency. The anonymity of cryptocurrency makes it possible for people to invest in it without being notice or seen.

I think there is a high probability that some politicians are investing in Bitcoin or other forms of crypto currency secretly but I don't think that they are scared about that being known by the public, they are scared of the blockchain technology to be used in the government in the future that will make corruption on government to be impossible and extremely hard to do.

We know that there are some people who would rather hide their investments to the public because they know that their position may be compromise when people knew it.

Yes, because ETH and most(if not all) cryptocurrencies are speculative investments. We're pretty much betting on their future success. But I don't think the lack of ICOs actually helped drop ETHs price. I think it's more because ICO projects have to sell a good amount of their collected ETH for them to be able to securely have funds ready for the wages of their employees; just so if ever ETH crashes more."

If only I had money, I would buy 10 eth. However, I think the dumping of eth is not just because of the inactive ICOs, but also because of the actions of the US government. One cannot be sure why the market is down but we must buy now before the bullrun occurs next month."

We pretty much bet on the future success of alcoin because Ethereum and most cryptocurrency are speculative investments. But I don't think the number of ICO scams really helps lower the price of Ethereum. I think it's more because the ICO project must sell a good amount of their collected Ethereum so they can safely have the funds ready to pay their employees."

I don't know the statistics yet on how the ICOs were going through lately but from people's judgement, I don't think they're gonna want to invest something even a single coin in an ICOs for now. I won't conclude from that point that ETH is just gonna keep going on dipping though. There are still a lot of factors to consider although Bitcoin covers those factors already. It becomes a personal preference or sometimes, evaluation.

yeah seems eth had a low price on market and I think it will dropped unto 150$ and when ETH hit that price I will buy eth cause I believe ETH will recover again soon sadly lots of altcoins dropped now and I hope it will rise again before year ends."

I strongly agree in that, bitcoin and ethereum is now on the huge dip, which means thatvis is now really the best time to buy due to its huge dip and we maybe need only a few amount of capital money to invest many more bitcoin and eth, so then i also i believe that this time is the right time to buy.

Infants don't know and elders likely don't know either. But you actually confirm my words. People heard about crypto, and if they got interested, they probably had already tried it, as a quick-buck opportunity in the very least. Whether they succeeded at that or made losses at the end of the day is another question. Still, I agree that insane volatility is not what common people are looking for, though it is not so much volatility itself as the dramatic decline as of recent on its own, taken separately. But that's what I'm talking about in the OP. We are going to see speculation winding down, along with prices, sorry. And that should give more room and leeway for real value to expand into, metaphorically speaking, at least in relative terms, and ultimately support solid, long-term growth.

In other words, there's no cloud without a silver lining."

Yeah i agree with this comment because i am too a small scale investor and as we all know that money could be use in another priorities. In my theory i guess the owner or huge scale investor of BTC has selling out some of his bitcoin to invest in another kind of investment that will surely last long.

This is an exaggerated conclusion because its not possible for everybody to know about bitcoin as you might be concluding based on your environment and the people that surrounds you. Over here, I know of educated people that have not heard about bitcoin and if you mention what is being done with blockchain and its potentials, it sound as if you are living in another world. Also, not everybody who wanted to invest had done so. A lot of people are still held back for several reasons. those who are risk averse, those who are scared of the legal ramifications and those who are holding back because of religious connotations and until their believes or fears have been voided, they still remain on the other sides."

I highly doubt this.
Hearing the news and reading a 3 lines article about bitcoin on the phone can hardly mean knowing about bitcoin, and not all the population has done even that. I'll put the number of people that have actually bothered to research bitcoin and crypto for at least 5 minutes just a bit above 2-5% percent and that only in the western world.
If we talk about 3rd world countries probably we should start with 0... %.

What we have experienced was a quick boom and everybody talked about how much $ you can make which was a turn-off for a lot of people who were afraid of a scam, a ponzi scheme and so on.

I completely agree that we should be selling Bitcoin's utility rather than its potential to help people make quick bucks. It has always been about that after all.

The problem I see right now though, is that Bitcoin's strengths are too niche to be able to attract a sizable part of the population. The average joe likely wouldn't care much about decentralization. Anonymity is cool, but in hindsight, it seems most people only really desire it if they have something to hide. Online payments can also be done with credit cards and debit cards, and they're mostly instant (and free) as far as customers are concerned. Efficient cross-border transfers is arguably its best feature at the moment, and while it's absolutely top-notch, few people require it enough to actually buy into the ecosystem.

I feel like crypto has barely scratched the surface as far as its potential goes. It'll probably be a while until utility can drive significant adoption by itself. I hope I'm proven wrong though lol."

Honestly, I don't think that the whale investors make up the major part of the cryptoverse. There are big holders, no doubt about that, but they are not investors. Anyway, everyone speaks about these investors but why are the prices falling down then? These people are not fools, they are going to be the fuel for market growth, speculative growth. Whoever had been investing in crypto before was doing that for profit. But speculation can't go on forever, right now it is steadily subsiding, along with prices. In my opinion, we are now entering a new stage, where real use will prevail over speculation. Obviously, prices won't be like they were in late 2017, but they will be real, even though that could mean 500-50-5 dollars per bitcoin (with most alts losing any value)."

This is true in respect to a single individual or a small group of individuals with varying personal traits and characters.

There is even a separate science behind this phenomenon which studies human behavior en masse, so to speak.

This is an exaggerated conclusion because its not possible for everybody to know about bitcoin as you might be concluding based on your environment and the people that surrounds you. Over here, I know of educated people that have not heard about bitcoin and if you mention what is being done with blockchain and its potentials, it sound as if you are living in another world. Also, not everybody who wanted to invest had done so. A lot of people are still held back for several reasons. those who are risk averse, those who are scared of the legal ramifications and those who are holding back because of religious connotations and until their believes or fears have been voided, they still remain on the other sides.

Yes, it is an exaggeration. You could even call it a hyperbole but I think you get the point I'm trying to get across. There is not plenty of really fresh money in the market, for whatever reason. And given the current state of the market, this is not going to change in the coming months."

Well, actually not so much doom and gloom but rather a ""scientific"" theory for a constructive and meaningful discussion.

There are many people in the world who do not pay taxes at all or underpaid. How do they keep their savings? All accounts are controlled by banks and governments. They can freeze the account at any time. Have access to your money from any country in the world and the ability to exchange bitcoins for any currency.

Frankly, I don't quite understand your point here. More specifically, I don't disagree that the governments are controlling the lives of the law-abiding community by various means including money. So far so good. But I can't grasp why ""these reasons are enough to always be willing to buy cryptocurrencies"". What does buying cryptocurrency give you if you still have to sell it later for the same dollars as you bought it with to get out of it any use that wouldn't be speculation? Other than that, the underpaid people usually don't have money to save as they live paycheck-to-paycheck. And as they are underpaid, it is more like half-paycheck."

This is actually a very good analysis of the situation. I would merit it but I am barely a Junior Member with zero sMerits..
What's wrong in this analysis is that it is not true that ""everybody knows about Bitcoin"" and even less that ""If they wanted to invest in crypto, they already did so"" - for most of the people buying Bitcoin is still a too complex task to achieve because of the tech. I have personally met so many people who would have liked to invest in Bitcoin but they are technologically impaired and they have no idea how to do that.
There will be other waves of new people joining the party. We will have new ATH, even though this might take a while. But sooner or later, your analysis will be 100% correct."

that is even more wrong.

why? it is simple, a lot of people have not even heard of bitcoin. they may have seen the name, saw some article online, on TV,... but they never even paid attention to it. it was something they passed by. and there are a lot more people who know about it, read the articles,... but they didn't invest in it because they were afraid of its future. for instance instead of reading what bitcoin is they read what Warren Buffet said about bitcoin so they decided not to get involved with bitcoin.

this will change in the future. the same people will start learning more about bitcoin and know how bullshit 99% of the articles about bitcoin that they read were. and the rest who haven't heard about bitcoin will know about it and that way the adoption increases.

even if we assume that no new person is going to adopt bitcoin (which is simply not true) the same investors are still investing more money in it so in a way price will rise even there were no new adoption!

Most people are living paycheck-to-paycheck and many are living on debt at that. They simply can't invest in anything due to sheer lack of money. So they are out of consideration for pretty apparent reasons.

Now we are left with those who have money and are willing to invest it in some asset. And I speak of these people exclusively.

But how many people actually understand clearly what bitcoin is about and what purpose it serves? Many have read the WP written by Satoshi, in part or fully. He says that he wants bitcoin to become a means of payment, and this is how it had been used for the first couple of years even if that use was limited and insignificant. But later it turned into a money-making machine but it doesn't look like it's got a lot closer to its destination point.

People are investing in bitcoin to make profits. Well, at least this is what they hope for, to earn money. But isn't investing about that thing exactly, making profits?

Bitcoin, the digital currency (cryptocurrency) which jumped more than 1,000% last year, is the first user of the blockchain application. This technology eliminates the need for third-party intermediaries such as banks to quickly and safely record transactions between two parties using encryption technology.

Since the development of Bitcoin, hundreds of cryptocurrency and other blockchain projects have emerged. Supporters say blockchain can one day change the world like the internet.

Anything can become obsolete. There are some drawbacks to using Bitcoin -- decentralization = inefficient due to redundancy, and proof-of-work under these incentives consumes lots of energy.

I have come to learn that everything in this market, and even if Bitcoin is actually the most powerful coin in the market right now, there's always that possibility for it to die down and lose its value. I think the more coins that are rising up, the more competition it would give Bitcoin, and there would always be some of them that could give it such competition that would give it a run for its money. Well, right now, there's no such coin yet, but if there would be more development and support from developers and the community, then there could certainly be more coins that could rise up near the level or even passed the level of Bitcoin that would make it obsolete."

You are talking nonsense.

First of all, bitcoin and blockchain goes together to create incentives to build and to mine, and accordingly, so far, bitcoin is the only blockchain that matters with any kind of significance including the varying network effects building upon it, and so these various other blockchains are mere imitations that largely serve as testnets for bitcoin.

To the extent any value comes from the various other cryptos or blockchains, then they are going to get absorbed into bitcoin.  So yeah, it is nonsense for you to be attempting to describe bitcoin and blockchain as if they are two separate things, and causes you to come off as some mainstream pundit that is trying to parse out bitcoin and either not understanding bitcoin or just putting out a confusing and misleading informational framework.

Another nonsense angle is for you to be suggesting that the innovation of bitcoin, which is in its budding stages of just getting started to be obsolete at any time in the near future.  What we have here is an innovation that has yet to be seen and developed, so before we start elaborating about its death, let's attempt to figure out where it is going first.  Way too fucking premature to be talking about death, when we hardly have any clue about the extent to which bitcoin is going to get adopted and also the varying systems that are likely to be built upon it.  So, yeah, less than 1% of world adoption makes discussion of birth and development to be much more relevant and timely than discussions about either demise or death."

With the superficial outlook of the whole scenario I am sure if blockchain goes dark then surely bitcoin does the same. They are dependent on each other or more precisely bitcoin depends on the blockchain technology and thus whatever happens to the blockchain technology does happen to the bitcoin as well. If there is core application of the bitcoin in the future then I am sure that it will have to be there and so as to blockchain technology too on which it is getting evolved today.

- I do not think so, obsolescence is happening with Bitcoin because we can see the development of bitcoin is facing many problems, even it is declining, although we all know it is a normal story, but over time, bitcoin is going down deeper, showing a marked downward trend.

I would never argue on this, for to be obsolete has no time frame. In fact, a lot of things in the past decade alone that changed the way we interact with each other (and also called revolutionary technology, just as blockchain and bitcoin) has become obsolete.

Take the case for instance of PDAs who first sports the trusty stylus. Palm Pilot was not able to budge a bit as they face extinction even though they revolutionized the way we interact with collective data.

And how about paid emails? A very promising profitable industry that went down the drain with the advent of gmail who simply gave away nearly unlimited mailbox space.

Remember dial-up? The cranky noise it creates that nearly last a minute or so was music to our ears just to go online!

All these revolutionary technology went obsolete in just a decade or so. So there's no telling how much time blockchain and bitcoin have.

Nonetheless, as bitcoin proves to be a store of value, we might enjoy it a little longer than others are predicting."

Whatever words that discribred bitcoin as long said coin is uselful and can help many people around as i think obsolete word is nothing to discribe said bitcoin, the important is the value that can change you life.

Yes, it's true, anything that tells Bitcoin, it is clear, bitcoin can change one's wealth, the word obsolete has many meanings, but it means the same as trite or nearing death, but I think it's true that you have no meaning, because Bitcoin will return to normal."

It is impossible because  aside from it is a number one  original bitcoin crypto currency in the world and it is dominated for a long time for almost 9 years until now people should stick on on crypto currency because of a good feature that brings this crypto to us.

What is the basis of your analysis that blockchain will be obselete?
I believe that through continuous innovation any product will not be obsolete but succeed and be perfected and that's how I'm seeing blockchain. Many people involve in blockchain and continuous research happening to utilize and maximize the use of blockchain technology. Ivy league universities like MIT and Oxford already have their eyes on blockchain. Companies already doing researched studies and many already using blockchain technologies and through time. Blockchain is a technology and technology don't go obsolete, they evolve.

As for bitcoin, it survive 10 years and will possibly survive 10folds of 10 years UNLESS people find a way to break the chain and solve the puzzle of how bitcoin works but that would also mean the end of all cryptocurrency coz all altcoins are base on bitcoin."

Satoshi is likely dead.  Bitcoin goes forward based on consensus, contribution and building on foundational principles that began through the whitepaper and Satoshi's initial direction.

Value and price might be two things, but it does seem that incentives are aligned in such a way that price and value continue to have decent correlation, so as long as the bitcoin network continues to create and attract value, likely price will continue to rise, and accordingly if price is rising, it wouldn't become obsolete.

Another question would be whether some other coin(s) might take some value and in the short term, we may witness some of these kinds of dynamics, but so long as bitcoin does not become broken, it seems likely that value is going to continue to migrate in the direction of bitcoin which remains the soundest of any of the cryptos and certainly more sound than fiat and even precious metals such as gold/silver."

1. More new coins and it's useless, thus;
2. There will be no demand.

From your analysis, then that means if blockchain has to become obsolete, then I think bitcoin will follow the suite. because blockchain is a technology where bitcoin is built."

If you develop an investment strategy towards bitcoin, and do not get distracted by a lot of the bullshit and disinformation and you attempt to learn from your strategy and even the developments in bitcoin, then there should be LITTLE to NO question that bitcoin is affordable.  You can buy whatever amount is in your budget, even if it happens to be as low as $5 per month.  So, the question does not involve price, but instead how you structure your own budget in order to figure out how much of it you are going to include in your budget and what systems for accumulation or maintenance of your BTC stash (or developing BTC stash) you are going to put in place."

Bitcoin I think as of today is already obsolete, why? because it really drops hard for Months and until now there is still no improvement in the value of bitcoin.

The number of people doing this are few are far between. 99% of transactions are speculatory in nature and this is a huge problem. Really I point to the block reward algorithm as being the main problem. It exacerbates demand shifts by also continually limiting supply more and more as time goes on. This leads to volatility and the boom and bust cycles we experience every few years. The real issues is that with every boom and bust cycle you alienate more and more people because most got in at the height of euphoria.

People don't do this because they are not incentivized to purchase anything. Who spends what they think and hope will be worth more tomorrow than today? The other thing is... Who wants to worry about whether your purchasing power will suddenly fall by 50 percent in a month. This is the issue of Cryptocurrencies and until it is fixed there is not much worth to it. Unlike say Gold that has demand for any number of things and is relatively stable in relation to say bread... Bitcoin's main purpose, despite what those SOV fools say, is to act as a medium of exchange. Since it does not do this very well due to volatility and other technical reasons it is still overpriced in my mind. I think the market will bleed for many more months to come and it could get really ugly. Sure the fanatics will stay around but everyone else will flee. The fanatics will say this is a good thing and it is trimming the fat but this is a resounding failure in thinking. No mass adoption occurs without the masses.  "

So why would you pay enormous amounts of money just to have these functions if they are equally available whether the price of Bitcoin is 0.001 $ or 6, 000 $, and more importantly if these functions can be realized with various alternative cryptos or fiat money?

Oh, you're that guy from potato thread repeating the same 'arguments' all over again.

I'll happily pay $0.001 for BTC1 but nobody is selling that low... What now?

If the market value of potato exceeded the value of my car - then yes, I'll be happy to make such trade.

Think of BTC as of expensive wine (ie $50,000/bottle), there's no way such wine is x2,000 tastier or stronger than $25/bottle wine (many would prefer taste of the cheaper one). The price is combination of scarcity/utility/future expectation/hype etc and is dictated only by supply and demand.

Let's put it this way. Nine years ago you had to pay 1,000 BTC in order to get dollar. Now you have to pay 0.00016 BTC.  In the same time period, both bitcoin and dollar had exactly the same utility - they functioned as a means of exchange. Now, why would a rational person spend six million times more dollars on something that has exactly the same utility as it had before?"

Seriously, you need to do a little better in explaining what exactly do you mean. Rational person would buy bitcoin either: as a speculative investment, as a hedge to current monetary system, or for its utility (ie. to easily transfer money).
In comparison to a potato, Bitcoin is not even a physical tangible good that can be used for satisfying human wants or needs, and its only utility is that it functions as payment protocol and money.

Guess what? A huge percentage of your beloved fiat money in banks are actually digital. Not everything is in paper money. And also, guess what? Some countries are already cashless, meaning that all(95%+) of their day to day transactions are actually digital. Does the intangible characteristic of their funds make it worthless? I don't think so.

And also, guess what!? Your beloved fiat money isn't backed by anything."

You are ignoring that bitcoin not only is a medium of exchange bitcoin is also a network, this is why Facebook is very valuable because it has billions of users, anyone can create a network similar to Facebook but the value of Facebook comes from its users, and the same applies to bitcoin now you need to pay more for each bitcoin because now there are more users willing to accept it, there is more demand and if there is more demand then that something because more valuable, that is just how the economy works."

I believe that huge dip is a great opportunity to buy more bitcoin and wait till the time when the price rise and sell.

The first idea is quite convenient. You can just do nothing. For the first time ever, doing nothing has actually become a heroic deed – people are proud to be hodlers, proud to do nothing with their cryptocurrency. But do you really believe this approach will change the world? Seriously?
 
Let’s be honest. Real crypto communities – there are few. There are few people who own cryptocurrency. The number is vanishingly small. Crypto prices will not grow while there are so few of us. The demand is just too small and there are no drivers of growth.
 
So, what should we do? Is there a reason to just sit and wait for cryptocurrencies to grow? I believe there is none. The only possible solution is that people actually start using crypto in their everyday lives. The number of crypto transactions should amount to hundreds of millions a day. Then, and only then, will cryptocurrencies grow in price.
 
Personally, I see no other options. However, this cannot be handled by one man alone. The whole crypto community should do this. You may ask: is it possible to live paying with cryptocurrencies only? Judging from our experience –  yes. Moreover, we have video proof: here is a story of a guy from Scotland https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb_yVnkHSFs and here is a story of a guy from Thailand https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l09U16Oqbck.
 
People will say I’m biased, since I founded a project where you can sell and buy goods for crypto. Yes, it’s true. Still, I’m more interested in expansion of cryptocurrencies than in my project’s expansion. In fact, I founded it for one simple reason: I’m sure that hodlers will never change the world. But we will. We should just learn from the guys in our videos who pay with cryptocurrencies in everyday life and make cryptocurrencies valuable.  "

Obviously, it is not ""for the first time ever"". People have been hoarding gold as well as other precious metals for centuries. You can find these people even here, on bitcointalk. Of course, they are not going to live a few centuries (though who knows), but they are not going to sell their precious pieces of shiny metal either. So it is about passing the wealth from one generation to the next one. Other than that, I essentially agree with everything you said. Hoarding something which has no intrinsic value is ultimately an exercise in stupidity and futility, and now it is time for this point to be proven in practice.

In fact, hoarding gold is not much different either, but in this case specifically you can at least be sure that your wealth won't turn into trash overnight. In simple terms, cryptocurrencies are not gold, digital or otherwise, and over the long term, holding them is very likely going to get you hurt badly."

It all depends if people bought Bitcoin for a reason (spend almost anonymously), if people earned the Bitcoin or bought it as investment.
Imho you have to understand all the sides of a situation in order to be fair and completely meaningful.

First two groups of people will sell, Bitcoin is just money, very good. The hodl part comes for investment, since many are not skilled for trading and they believe/believed that holding will make them profit (may still do!).
In this case holding may still be okay. 1 Bitcoin = 1 Bitcoin. And it stays so until you sell. If you bought it in mid-December and selling now, that's quite a loss. If you don't, you still have one Bitcoin. This is what holding is for.

Unfortunately far too many have invested in Bitcoin with the hope of getting rich quick. They are now biased - if they sell they lose, if they don't, they may lose even more - and the hold advises may give them hope. Because the market nowadays is not normal and may recover. However, it's clearly not the best advice, not for everybody. But your advice is as bad as the ""HODL"" ones. The best advise is ""use your brain and do as it suits you best"".

I also don't agree that the price will grow only when the number of transactions will grow. As I said, it's not a normal market. I think that the manipulation is too big. When that'll end, there could be a recovery, maybe some +50%. Of course, some dream of 20k+, they have to wait a bit more. Of course, there cold be a drop to 2k or even 1k. That's why people have to use their own judgement in investing."

We don't need to but those who believe it are free to do so. With the growth of blockchain tech and its adoption, it is inevitable that cryptocurrencies will improve as well and rise in price(because it is the first in the field to apply blockchain after all)."
1461;2018-06-29 12:28:21;Dr.Nina;Jr. Member;84;0;Bitcoin is designed to use as a currency. But many people use it as a invested platform.  It has been invented in two thousand nine. But it has become popular in last year when its price rustically go up and people consider it as an investment platform. At that time people think it as money making machine. But this concept is going to end. Now time has come to turn our concept from investment to mood of payment. If this concept spread among us then the user of bitcoin will increase and we the  user of bitcoin will be benefited.

I disagree with your point of view. You seem to be putting the cart before the horse. Bitcoin is not the only currency which can be used for making payments. If we take litecoin as an example, a coin which is technically just a more advanced version of bitcoin itself, there are no such issues as high transaction fees or slow confirmation times (and it has LN activated for over a year by now). But it is still not used widely. What does it tell us? Basically, that there is no demand for crypto as a means of payment, and this is the real problem.

I don't see why volatility is not an issue(though I'm open on being educated), I'm sure you know the pizza story. Even the day to day changes can be scary for a businessman.

In my opinion, for a cryptocurrency to be accepted widely as payment system, it needs to actually compete with existing payment systems, like paypal or visa. Transaction speed of most cryptocurrencies are nowhere near these payment systems. The fastest we have is ripple, but it has such a bad name I doubt people would use it.

Also, the low demand for cryptocurrencies as a payment system is not the problem, it's the effect of these problems."

Let’s be honest. Real crypto communities – there are few. There are few people who own cryptocurrency. The number is vanishingly small. Crypto prices will not grow while there are so few of us. The demand is just too small and there are no drivers of growth.

The only possible solution is that people actually start using crypto in their everyday lives. The number of crypto transactions should amount to hundreds of millions a day. Then, and only then, will cryptocurrencies grow in price.

That's a very wise idea when hodlers may change the world through suppressing coins dumps.

I think any trader or holder has an impact on the crypto market, because they are the ones who directly create the volatility. In addition, hoders will also be a factor in increasing and decreasing prices in the market as they affect the supply of crypto.

Well that is the goal and purpose of cryptocurrencies in general.

But, do you really think bitcoin is ready for that? We already know it's limits and weaknesses. The moment the network clogs, transaction fees skyrocket and speed gets really slow. Add that to a very volatile nature, it's no surprise that users and markets find it hard to use it as a payment system. We know these numbers, and guess what, that's nowhere near the numbers we'll reach if people use it, say, in amazon or even smaller online markets.

The development is just extremely slow. I do like to see cryptocurrencies do what it's meant to do, but I guess we'll still have to wait a couple more years for that.

I disagree with your point of view. You seem to be putting the cart before the horse. Bitcoin is not the only currency which can be used for making payments. If we take litecoin as an example, a coin which is technically just a more advanced version of bitcoin itself, there are no such issues as high transaction fees or slow confirmation times (and it has LN activated for over a year by now). But it is still not used widely. What does it tell us? Basically, that there is no demand for crypto as a means of payment, and this is the real problem.

Also, volatility is not an issue either as there are plenty of ways to make it irrelevant, which is what payment processors and gateways do on a daily basis.

Nice! I did not know LTC had LN already. I thought it is being researched still for BTC.
Actually the demand comes from use. Japan and other countries do accept it as use of payment, but probably at higher/lower fees, depends.
You can easily set up your bitstamp account to accept the currency you want, and automatically sell that for the fiat you want. Sell coffee at your shop? Set up your payment systems of choice ."

Those people who sell in a panic - this is just the tip of the iceberg. When we see a sharp drop in the price of Bitcoin, it's not the hamsters that sell it, but whales that set the mood for the whole market. It is worth acknowledging that Bitcoin has long been managed by a small group of people."

I'll give you merit for this.
I spend lots of time in altcoin section and everyone is repeating hold until market goes green or hold until whale come, they don't understand market will never go green if everyone is holding.
Other side of story, if everyone is holding no one is using crypto, without real use crypto will die. People should go back to 2009. and read what bitcoin is and for what it is created.
Perhaps holding every crypto won't really happen in real world because it is in fact that there were short-term traders too compared to long term-traders which the one who decides to hold if their portfolio was in red.
Yeah, i agree what you just said that if everyone was holding the market won't make any progress and i think the price correction are making some changes somehow if everyone was holding."

The first idea is quite convenient. You can just do nothing. For the first time ever, doing nothing has actually become a heroic deed – people are proud to be hodlers, proud to do nothing with their cryptocurrency. But do you really believe this approach will change the world? Seriously?
 
Let’s be honest. Real crypto communities – there are few. There are few people who own cryptocurrency. The number is vanishingly small. Crypto prices will not grow while there are so few of us. The demand is just too small and there are no drivers of growth.
 
So, what should we do? Is there a reason to just sit and wait for cryptocurrencies to grow? I believe there is none. The only possible solution is that people actually start using crypto in their everyday lives. The number of crypto transactions should amount to hundreds of millions a day. Then, and only then, will cryptocurrencies grow in price.
 
Personally, I see no other options. However, this cannot be handled by one man alone. The whole crypto community should do this. You may ask: is it possible to live paying with cryptocurrencies only? Judging from our experience –  yes. Moreover, we have video proof: here is a story of a guy from Scotland https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb_yVnkHSFs and here is a story of a guy from Thailand https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l09U16Oqbck.
 
People will say I’m biased, since I founded a project where you can sell and buy goods for crypto. Yes, it’s true. Still, I’m more interested in expansion of cryptocurrencies than in my project’s expansion. In fact, I founded it for one simple reason: I’m sure that hodlers will never change the world. But we will. We should just learn from the guys in our videos who pay with cryptocurrencies in everyday life and make cryptocurrencies valuable.

I basically support that view but let's admit it, ""personal gain"" may have quite different meanings for different people. And it is definitely far from ""one size fits all"" thing. It may mean different things even for people at the same social level with the same income. Some are looking exclusively for monetary gains (and that's okay if you ask me), even though, as you said, they make up the majority not just around here but everywhere in the world. They don't give a fuck if their actions do or do not change the world. But for some people changing the world is actually the top priority, and you shouldn't discard them as some like Hitler may have really pervert ideas about it and be looking for something nasty and ugly."

In order for Bitcoin to keep gaining value, and to maintain it, hoarding and hodling is the most important factor. Without people willing to hoard and hodl the price right now wouldn't even be close to the $1000 mark.

The only reason we currently aren't going up is because there are too many coins circulating in the market due to hodlers having dumped a lot during the bull run. These coins need to be bought up by other hodlers.

As long as that isn't the case, then there is no point even thinking about an increase in the very short term without an ETF or something else taking coin out of circulation. Respect to all the hodlers out there!"

Everything inside me revolts against this statement. More specifically, hoarding or hodling may help boost the price in the short term indeed, but it is devastatingly detrimental to the long-term success of a coin, when the dust settles and speculation returns to its base levels. A cryptocurrency should be used as a currency to have real value. In essence, you are claiming that being scarce is sufficient for being valuable but it is not the case. To have value an asset should not just be scarce, it should also be useful at that. If it is not, then no matter how scarce it is, it will be worthless.

So for me i agree that we should use cryptocurrency not just hold it but for them to grow it should start with big players to accept or adopt it as means of payment and people will come and the demand will rise also. This is my opinion.

Lack of adoption hardly makes the community forced to convert to FIAT first before they able to use it. The platform that OP created is essentially needed in the current situation of the community. It definitely helps the adoption of Bitcoin.

Let’s be honest. Real crypto communities – there are few. There are few people who own cryptocurrency. The number is vanishingly small. Crypto prices will not grow while there are so few of us. The demand is just too small and there are no drivers of growth.

The only possible solution is that people actually start using crypto in their everyday lives. The number of crypto transactions should amount to hundreds of millions a day.

Sadly, this is the reason most people are interested in bitcoin. They simply buy to HODL. They believe they don't have to do anything whatsoever to make money other than to buy and HODL. I know some people who don't know the current price of bitcoin just because they have bought it since 2016 and just left it there.
However, bitcoin is not made for that alone. Bitcoin should be used everyday. This is the reason why day traders should be appreciated. They help use bitcoin almost on a daily basis and this is what is needed for the price of bitcoin to grow."

Day traders look better to me than long-term holders, but let's not forget that it is still speculation and not real use. Further, while small-time day traders may actually add up to market liquidity (at least, this is what economic textbooks tell us), there are also big fish who are particularly interested in insane levels of volatility because through this volatility they earn hefty profits by taking money from small fish. And this kind of speculation doesn't have any positive effect on bitcoin real economy as no sane merchant or producer will use currencies as volatile as crypto, bitcoin included."

And this is the problem. As long as people try to use crypto or bitcoin specifically as a vehicle for speculation, merchants and producers won't accept it. Speculation means volatility but why would they be willing to accept bitcoin if they can safely use the US dollar or whatever? Indeed, in some shady businesses using fiat currencies may not be an option (unless we are talking about cash) but these don't count for much. Apart from that, crypto is not actually used as a store of value as, for example, gold is used when it is passed from one generation to the next. Most people just keep the coins until the price rises enough and then they sell out. This is the same speculation, a couch potato one."

To tell the truth, it had been working like a charm for at least since August, 2015, and till December, 2017, that is for more than two years in a row. People could actually buy at whatever price and then literally sit on their hands doing nothing until the price hit a new time high eventually. So don't get surprised when you see people crying now.

I was not aware that holders wanted to change the world, your desire is correct but your argument is flawed, in a capitalist economy people are going to look for their self interest, all of those that are holding are thinking that they will get bigger benefits from holding their coins than the benefits they can get of spending their coins right now and the past of bitcoin proves they are right, if you want them to spend you will need to incentivize them to do it and that will only happen when the price is very high and we can use bitcoin directly for most transactions."

Absolutely right. When only few people really use cryptocurrencies in their daily life, that is the only way the demand of crypto will increase and the market will lively play on the cycle of buy and sell of cryptocurrencies. Hodlers can stop this cycle and the outcome when everyone have patience of holding crypto is like choking it until it slowly die.

The only possible solution is that people actually start using crypto in their everyday lives. The number of crypto transactions should amount to hundreds of millions a day. Then, and only then, will cryptocurrencies grow in price.
 
Personally, I see no other options. However, this cannot be handled by one man alone. The whole crypto community should do this. You may ask: is it possible to live paying with cryptocurrencies only? Judging from our experience –  yes. Moreover, we have video proof: here is a story of a guy from Scotland https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb_yVnkHSFs and here is a story of a guy from Thailand https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l09U16Oqbck.
 
People will say I’m biased, since I founded a project where you can sell and buy goods for crypto. Yes, it’s true. Still, I’m more interested in expansion of cryptocurrencies than in my project’s expansion. In fact, I founded it for one simple reason: I’m sure that hodlers will never change the world. But we will. We should just learn from the guys in our videos who pay with cryptocurrencies in everyday life and make cryptocurrencies valuable.

There is a common practice showing people are willing to buy for crypto while sellers willing to recieve such payments. We can see it on our platform: not many but still dozens of deals take place daily and people are happy. I mean both, sellers and buyers."

Some speculation about Bitcoin is not the same while the others are contrary to the flow of Bitcoin. We have to simplify about the exact difinition of Bitcoin. Some other people says, Bitcoin is digital gold, and others is Bitcoin crypto currency used for payment, the exact flow flow of Bitcoin is ""Bitcoin multi tasking all transaction before now making as one"" all transaction you have think about about Bitcoin is applicable because Bitcoin is a special product of new generation high technology."

I was not aware that holders wanted to change the world, your desire is correct but your argument is flawed, in a capitalist economy people are going to look for their self interest, all of those that are holding are thinking that they will get bigger benefits from holding their coins than the benefits they can get of spending their coins right now and the past of bitcoin proves they are right, if you want them to spend you will need to incentivize them to do it and that will only happen when the price is very high and we can use bitcoin directly for most transactions.
Your argument is flawed too

Why? Because you think ""spending"" is an one-way activity. But when people start to spend Bitcoins, then there are other people receiving them.

Pro Tip: You can be one of them! Simply accept it for your own work. That's obviously easier if you're a freelancer, but even if you're employed in a tech business it may be possible for you to be paid in Bitcoin.

Money as a lot of circularity in it. The more people spend and receive, the more importance it has as a communication tool to bring together ""producers"" and ""consumers"". We all (if we aren't too lazy, or are children or pensioneers) fit into both roles in some way. And Bitcoin is competing with other forms of money, so the more it is used, the more importance - and thus, value - it will get.

So the OP is totally right. I have also started a similar thread once in the Altcoin section, when all the ""hodlers"" were whining about the bear market and the losses. If you want your coin to grow - use it!"

Holders can not change the world, especially in cryptocurrency. But they have a role in the stability of cryptocurrency, they keep their coins without worrying about prices that will continue to fall. They are people who believe in cryptocurrency, much better than panic sellers.
Indeed hodler help in the control of instability of cryptocurrency prices. The reason for the ups and downs in cryptocurrency prices is just because of how people panic when there is a bad news concerning crypto. They do not consider whether it is a fake news or from a trusted source and even if it is from a trusted source, by hodling your coins the price should be a little stabilized. I do not think people from the US will change their USD to a different currency when the dollar starts to depreciate. So it is our own making that crypto is the way it is."

What hodlers should understand is that they can achieve the same effect if they follow the strategy I outlined in this earlier post: spend & accept.

They simply have to plan a bit and keep checking their balance: approximately spend the same amount of BTC in a timeframe (e.g. per month) than the amount of BTC they get as an income.

I know that not so much people may have the opportunity to accept BTC for their work. But they could start a freelance side-project and gradually reduce hours of their regular job (if they can) and so slowly become more independent from the fiat system. Or, if this is not possible, the easy way: every month re-buy the same amount of BTC than they spent. That should be possible for everybody, and it already helps the ecosystem.

The only disadvantage is in countries like Germany where you have tax advantages if you hold your coins for more than a year. In this case I would hold exactly a year and then start the ""spend & receive"" cycle.

Our experience shows that customers are ready to buy for crypto, while sellers are ready to accept it. We see it on our platform where deals are made and transactions are performed. Even though there are not many of them, dozens maybe, but still transactions are performed and people are happy. The sellers are happy and so are the customers."

Unfortunately far too many have invested in Bitcoin with the hope of getting rich quick. They are now biased - if they sell they lose, if they don't, they may lose even more - and the hold advises may give them hope. Because the market nowadays is not normal and may recover. However, it's clearly not the best advice, not for everybody. But your advice is as bad as the ""HODL"" ones. The best advise is ""use your brain and do as it suits you best"".

I also don't agree that the price will grow only when the number of transactions will grow. As I said, it's not a normal market. I think that the manipulation is too big. When that'll end, there could be a recovery, maybe some +50%. Of course, some dream of 20k+, they have to wait a bit more. Of course, there cold be a drop to 2k or even 1k. That's why people have to use their own judgement in investing.

Agreed, it's not the Hodlers neither number of transactions which may change the world, it's coming from above, the government should regulate whether to allows people using bitcoin as means of payment or just let them pseudonymous. Nevertheless, doesn't mean we can't do anything about it, for example; the current price slowly increase driven by ETF proposals, once it gets approval, more accredited investors and institutional capital get into the sector.

i also think the same with you,
if we hold a coin, but can not be used properly or just wait without any buying and selling activity then it has no meaning whatsoever.

it is very wise if we have a strategy to sell or buy it back to add our income.
with the small role of us (like buying and selling) we also participate in changing the state of the market.

It is thanks to HODL participants that the crypto currency market is developing now, because thanks to the fact that they do not cash their crypto currency, this market survived in difficult times.
Correct, while there are many million coins that have being mined only a small portion of them are in circulation this creates scarcity and we know what happens when something is low in supply and the demand is high right? The price goes up and this is why many people that never thought the price of bitcoin could reach 19k were completely surprised when that happened."

My thoughts exactly! The best approach would be trading with it but that also has a down side. If you don't have a lot,there is the increased fear about losing it. I am currently hodling a little and using the rest to trade.
Just trading your bitcoin does not work either, you are just sending bitcoin back and forth in transactions where no products and services are being exchanged by money this is just a way to try to make the economy of bitcoin seem more active than what it really is, at least the holders are doing a service to the community by lowering the supply of bitcoin and increasing the value while traders do the opposite."

Yeah... it's true what you say. Someone who only holds a coin without active activity (buying and selling) then it does not mean. He does not have role in changing the state of the market. Whether or not there is such a person then the state of the market will remain, it does not contribute any change to the state of the market. Therefore as a wise player then we should arrange the sales and purchase strategy so that not just holding it.
but when buying and selling actively also have to know the event that will occur on the coin that we will buy, by knowing information from social media such as twitter, facebook, and others.
because if there is no event, the coin will not increase. and we should set aside some of our money on bitcoin when bitcoin rises and even daily trading profits, then we have 2 advantages."

Yes there is, If there are more lot's of holders and day by day the demand increase even a little it can affect the market. Less supply and more demand will cause the price to go up.

Well, there already are websites where you can shop using crypto but they still need promotion and more people/companies to post ads.

There are two opinions in the crypto world: some people consider cryptocurrencies digital gold, while others believe that cryptocurrencies will be used as means of payment.
 
The first idea is quite convenient. You can just do nothing. For the first time ever, doing nothing has actually become a heroic deed – people are proud to be hodlers, proud to do nothing with their cryptocurrency. But do you really believe this approach will change the world? Seriously?
 
Let’s be honest. Real crypto communities – there are few. There are few people who own cryptocurrency. The number is vanishingly small. Crypto prices will not grow while there are so few of us. The demand is just too small and there are no drivers of growth.
 
So, what should we do? Is there a reason to just sit and wait for cryptocurrencies to grow? I believe there is none. The only possible solution is that people actually start using crypto in their everyday lives. The number of crypto transactions should amount to hundreds of millions a day. Then, and only then, will cryptocurrencies grow in price.
 
Personally, I see no other options. However, this cannot be handled by one man alone. The whole crypto community should do this. You may ask: is it possible to live paying with cryptocurrencies only? Judging from our experience –  yes. Moreover, we have video proof: here is a story of a guy from Scotland https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gb_yVnkHSFs and here is a story of a guy from Thailand https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l09U16Oqbck.
 
People will say I’m biased, since I founded a project where you can sell and buy goods for crypto. Yes, it’s true.

An interesting point really.  And i do side with you when you said that the only way for cryptocurrency to grow even larger is by growing the numbers of crypto users.

And now the problem. When many opinionated crypto enthusiasts are shouting HODL as the best stance, how do we convince novice to spend their bitcoins for everyday commodities?

We are currently at a stage where the principles of bitcoin spending and hodling is at conflict. The initial design to be an electronic cash shifted to crypto investment. And it is quite frustrating and confusing at the same time.

Nonetheless, i side with you on the premise of utilization. Bitcoin needs to be useful and utilized in order for it to grow more in value."

Please explain it to us, they are holding their coins because thy think those coins are worth it, this reduces the supply and makes the coins even more valuable and scarce, how can that be a bad thing? And if that was not enough many holders dedicate time, energy and a lot of money to their coins, something that the average user of cryptocurrencies does not do, so explain how the holders make coins useless."

maybe people who hold their assets can't change the world, but in a way, I think they know when it's time to change the world. they are of course waiting for the right time to sell the assets they have. well, of course they hold something with strategy."

So, what should we do? Is there a reason to just sit and wait for cryptocurrencies to grow? I believe there is none. The only possible solution is that people actually start using crypto in their everyday lives. The number of crypto transactions should amount to hundreds of millions a day. Then, and only then, will cryptocurrencies grow in price.

People, you know, are mostly conservative, so it will take some more time for crypto to be massively adopted than we expect.
Hu dreds of millions transactions a day, you say? That's possible only in case at least 50 million people actively use crypto for their payments. How many active wallets are there now? Around 30 million? And how many real users own thise wallets? 5-10 million?

Only one of my questions, is bitcoin really ready to be used as a currency? Because, we both know. There are still some obstacles to bitcoin if it is used as a payment tool. Especially regarding transaction speed and transaction costs

Yes this statement might be true. Holders will not change the world but they could change their world by holding.  Holding until the price gets high could make themselves profitable when they sell their coins in the market.

But the real question should be whether the holders are really going to change the world for the better if ever. What is it in holding that makes it so beneficial for the world? Personally, I can't come up with anything which justifies holding apart from personal gains by selling when the price hits the sky. From my perspective, it is effectively just a postponed consumption which is not a good thing in itself.

Am I missing some important detail in the grander picture?
Hodlers will change the world for better and I consider myself one of them, because we can do the best what we can do for the price to soar higher. If we don't hodle, then who can do it for us? The whales always look out for a good timing when to take over and be back to track. Price will have to be profitable as long as there's more demand to happen, and investors like big whales along with long term holders will patiently wait for the right time as well.

But what's the point of holding other than obtaining personal gain? Do you hold for the common good or are actually pursuing the purpose of acquiring wealth for yourself? And what makes you think that not holding will hurt anyone (let's reverse your logic here)? In the simplest of terms, what makes you think that if no one doesn't do something, it is necessarily good, in this case, ""if we don't hodle, then who can do it for us""?

It is like ""no one eats shit, so who if not us""?

Your questions are right on point, I'd really like to see a hodler answering all of them, lol

It could be argued that saving provides financing for the real sector as you have to save first to make big investments in productive capacities later (though you can just borrow the money, for that matter). But with crypto there is no real sector to invest in, so it all comes down to personal gain without adding anything to the pie in return, which is the case with real investments.

In this manner, the only benefit that long-term holding offers is price rise due to coin supply running dry, even though it becomes possible only through volatility rather than solid growth. But it kills the purpose of any coin pretending to be money because money should circulate to be called currency."

Bitcoin is designed to use as a currency. But many people use it as a invested platform.  It has been invented in two thousand nine.

But this concept is going to end. Now time has come to turn our concept from investment to mood of payment. If this concept spread among us then the user of bitcoin will increase and we the  user of bitcoin will be benefited.

The people that are so called Whales today, weren't they HODLERs? They hodled with a believe in the technology and the asset(s) based on what it has to offer the world at large. Thus over time, they've been able to liberate themselves from the financial shackles. Thus I totally disagree with your point that HODLER can never change the world. You could have best expatiate more on the usefulness of constant trading."

Holders are making a future for everyone. I am one of those hodlers and hopefully, I can manage to hold until the market gives us a good price. Once thing is certain, if you hold the right coins for the right period of time I think the result will be some profit. You may not believe they can change the world but when it comes to making profits in high percentages, it will be noticed and felt by the world.
I doubt that, If everyone decide to keep holding and there is no demand in the market, nothing would drive the price higher, For every successful market everyone has their part to play from active traders to panic sellers and those whose sell for little profit, but, I doubt strong holders really have any huge impact in the market as they have no influence in the current price of the market.

But there is demand. If there wasn't then bitcoin would be worthless so it would be useless to spend and pointless to hold. In fact, holders contribute to the demand by temporarily taking coins out of circulation so holders have their place just like spenders do. I say let the hodlers hodl and the spenders spendl  .

Hodlers versus spendlers (like in spend for dear life), lol. Strictly speaking, holdlers do not contribute to demand itself, all they do is decrease the supply side. But the effect is essentially the same as the aggregate demand starts to exceed the aggregate supply and then prices start to grow on a supply running dry, which in turn increases volatility due to lower number of coins left in the market. On the other hand, spendlers change the supply side directly either by increasing it when they sell their coins in the open market, or by spending elsewhere, which also ultimately leads to an increase in supply."

Hodlers obviously don't increase the value merely just by holding, but they do if the demand is still there or growing, and that's what most of them are hoping for. Hold coins now to sell at a later date when they're more in demand and therefore more valuable."

I think that long-term investment and choose the best coin, will definitely bring people huge profits. Long-term investments are safer especially for newcomers and those with little investment experience.

Safer for new comers and with little investment experience? How can be Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies be a good thing for these newbs? They are not even used to invest on the most common and popular investment and you will be suggesting them cryptocurrencies?

The first reason why these cryptocurrencies are not ""safe"" to them is because there are a lot of scams that they don't know about. If they are new to investing and they will be investing on these projects, how will they know the legitimate project and the scam? Scammers are so smart these days that you can't tell the difference of the legitimate to the fake. Another one is that we all know of, they are volatile. We all know what happens to investors that has a weak hands, they don't earn profit. They quickly hands off to investments that falls down and they don't wait."

There are two opinions in the crypto world: some people consider cryptocurrencies digital gold, while others believe that cryptocurrencies will be used as means of payment.
 
The first idea is quite convenient. You can just do nothing. For the first time ever, doing nothing has actually become a heroic deed – people are proud to be hodlers, proud to do nothing with their cryptocurrency. But do you really believe this approach will change the world? Seriously?
 
Let’s be honest. Real crypto communities – there are few. There are few people who own cryptocurrency. The number is vanishingly small. Crypto prices will not grow while there are so few of us. The demand is just too small and there are no drivers of growth.
 
So, what should we do? Is there a reason to just sit and wait for cryptocurrencies to grow? I believe there is none. The only possible solution is that people actually start using crypto in their everyday lives. The number of crypto transactions should amount to hundreds of millions a day. Then, and only then, will cryptocurrencies grow in price.
 
Personally, I see no other options. However, this cannot be handled by one man alone. The whole crypto community should do this. You may ask: is it possible to live paying with cryptocurrencies only? Judging from our experience –  yes.

If people do hodl then they probably wanted some change and they are starting it. You cannot pleased everyone but with a small effort it will.have a big impact.

at least hodler narrows the panic conditions and in the end many of them will do the same thing, in some buying momentum, they will also act positively, lots of rich people because they hold bitcoin starting from 7-8 years ago, and their attitude deserves to be praised because it is not affected by the fundamentals and continues to increase nominal regularly. this is what causes bitcoin to become popular as it is today."

I believe the same thing because today the problem is panic sellers and they are the main reason why bitcoin price is falling down without a reason in a higher rate but thanks to holders at least those situations are getting controlled and the other problem is as of today due to bitcoins less adaptation into businesses and organizations there are no many opportunities that are available to use bitcoin frequently so the only options to do are trade or hold"

Agree with you and also with the OP statement but still here with the holding we can give lots of positivity to the people over the holidjngs , in this field most of the people are small trader and holders and only small numbers of the people are big earners and holder who holds assets , but here if a small negativity run in the market then that negativity results into big dump Because most of small holders sell Thier holding , and at another side of the big amount of assets holders will remain stable then in that case small holders get lots of positivity that if the big holders are positive then surely in that case why not we should hodlour small amount , Because our loss is small but loss of them ( high portfolio holders ) .
So a positivity works much better for us .
But still beside all these things we cans we that lots of negate news creater and Fuds are creater in this field who create Fuds , so it is not easy for the big holders to remain stable at Thier assets , Because I seen that many big hodlers also even are lossing Thier hope in the present time dump ."

It was the same realization i had. The hodlers might be able to increase the demand, but without utiization, cryptocurrencies won't have any value at all.

I stopped after reading few lines, and the word regulated popping all over shows your iq is very low when it comes to bitcoins. It's clear you saw bitcoins on the net, saw it's price fluctuations,  and jumped to conclusions without even studying it, Bitcoins cannot be regulated period.

If we wanted a regulated crypto, I would buy fiat not crypto, it's a reason it's decentralised there's no need to change it. I would recommend you to read up on bitcoins, or stay away as you'll end up in looses.

No the trust has not been lost, the community understands the fluctuations and is backing bitcoins, we'll know pump and dump is going to happen, and that's how one makes money, you need to learn this trade."

I actually want it to be regulated. I say that because there are so many positive implications that could happen in the betterment of cryptocurrencies and the market if that will happen. The fact that most of the coins right now are being doubted because of the negative happenings in the market is just so rampant; however, if it will be regulated, which means that there would be laws that could actually be made for its protection, then that will indirectly send people the message that it is a legitimate and legal asset, and so, that would give cryptocurrencies more trust from people that could improve the market tenfold."

We are not asking the government for permission, we are telling them that this is how it is.
Here is a briefly story which I have found on medium (https://medium.com/swlh/should-bitcoin-be-regulated-9e1155c1d56e) First created in 2009 by a person with the alias Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoin became the pioneer of cryptocurrency and Blockchain technology. Bitcoin is a digital currency in which encryption and cryptography are used to control the value and verify the transactions. While traditional currency goes to central payment processors, such as Visa and MasterCard, Bitcoin transactions are processed by computers running special software. Every time a transaction occurs, the network records both the sender’s and the receiver’s Bitcoin addresses, and the amount of money into the end of a “Ledger” or a record called Blockchain. After nearly a decade since its invention, Blockchain has not yet reached to its full potential. Billions of dollars of investments are made every day, but none of the great potentials come to reality, despite only serving Bitcoin for its payment system and allows illegal payments to occur in the Dark Web. The government has started to underestimate the value of Bitcoin and thinks that regulation is the best way to solve its issue. On the other side, the majority Blockchain developers do not approve the regulatory framework proposed by the government, as they think Blockchain will still reach to something significant in the long run. Many tech investors view the Blockchain in the future as a host for applications, such as crowdfunding and online voting. Although cryptocurrencies have several downsides, strict regulations from the government are not the right solution as they would decrease the market value and prevent the Blockchain from reaching its full potential, such as managing personal identity and improving representative democracy.

The core technology in Bitcoin which is called Blockchain is what makes Bitcoin special as many tech experts claim it to be hacker proof. Back when Bitcoin and computers have were not yet invented, the most popular way for people to keep their secret documents is by keeping them in a vault and making a lot of copies. Thus, when someone else stole the person’s document without breaking into the vault, the victim would still have other copies in different locations. Similar to Blockchain, files or any pieces of information are encrypted so that only a specific person could read or write the file, which are stored in thousands of computers but still linked together with the internet. The computers combine which store all the files are called node-blocks and the network connecting all the files are called chain. The encrypted code will get updated every several hours which makes the entire system almost impossible for a hacker to break in."

But sorry, Bitcoin really can not be adjusted. But I think someday Bitcoin will do this so that it can be accepted by the government, so that it can be widely used.
Governments can monitor their fiat channels since they have a very strict control over them but if at some point in the future people begin to accept bitcoin directly for all kind of products and services governments are going to have a huge problem not only regulating bitcoin but the rest of the economy as well since we will not need to follow their rules."

No, it is a decentralized currency. And bitcoin, like most things is regulated in many ways by many different countries.

The good thing is that no one is going to listen to him, governments are going to try to regulate bitcoin, there is no doubt about it but the developers are never going to change the code to make the life of governments easier and since code is law in this market then it does not matter, but more than ever I really think we need a DEX that works soon, so we can exchange our coins without having to use centralized parties.

Yes most people think opposite of the OP, so don't worry about it.
It is nice to hear it because most people are easily deceived and are ready to exchange their freedom for security as soon as they can, while bitcoin is the opposite, we are sacrificing some security when it comes to our coins in order to get unlimited freedom, this is why once you send your coins there is no way to get them back, you need to be completely sure of what you are doing and if you make a mistake no one can fix it for you."

I agree that in the end it will gradually eliminate anonymous features, in the free and global markets, there must be rules to take into account the use, otherwise bitcoin will be controlled by a handful of people who will become greedy in monopolizing the large capital prices they use anonymously."

Yeah indeed, it is important for us to know the persons behind this Bitcoin procedures; the inventors, developers, or the proponents. The stability of Bitcoin will be constant if the society understand the owners of the procedures.

Thus, I think it would be better if they allow the people to be part of the development. With that, the assurance of the long term procedures of Bitcoin will increase."

It’s also difficult to regulate Bitcoin when, in actual fact, regulations vary from country to country. The only similarity may very well be those countries where cryptocurrency is banned or restricted. The issue of how it is classified also comes up again when looking at a global view of Bitcoin.

In an Investopedia article, a roundup of countries illustrates some of the varied regulations related to cryptocurrency. Here are some examples of the different regulations:

- Australia wants to tax cryptocurrency like other commercial transactions but is also cautious after security concerns from losses in 2013.
- Brazil has enacted a law about electronic currencies and payment systems, leading the way in evolving its regulations.
- Canada would like to tax Bitcoin but it is currently not recognized as legal tender so as no legal recognition.
- China restricts its use and does allow financial institutions to conduct any transactions using Bitcoin.
- The European Union has spent time debating the issue and has found some ways to tie a legal basis for Bitcoin to its existing laws, but the European Banking Authority is still against it until it becomes regulated.
- Finland has created specific instructions on how it can be used. It also has made any gains from these transactions subject to capital gains tax.
- India has shut down the country’s largest Bitcoin trading platform and currently has no regulatory framework for cryptocurrency.
- Russia restricts the use of Bitcoin and is concerned over its potential for use in money laundering or terrorist activities.
- The UK does not currently regulate cryptocurrency but does subject profits or losses on Bitcoin trading to capital gains tax while VAT is applied to any goods that are sold in exchange for this digital currency.

Many more countries are in similar places to these listed here, but these examples illustrate just how far apart the world is on reaching some type of agreement on regulations of Bitcoin.

For now if this is regulated it would be hard for those traders who earned lesser profit. While the value of bitcoin wasn't gaining yet it's not good to regulate due to small capabilities of earning better income. If Government will dominate the system, I don't think it will be fair for long time users of bitcoin.

So, if in this society, young and old will be separated, what is the future of this world. And, time we always said, I will have my lambo, I can go to moon - for my future. So think, FUTURE, when? Its an implication we need to resolve on our simple decision of rivalry. We tend to destroy and separate where there is an alternative way - teamwork and acceptance."

I don't see anything wrong with that should bitcoin be regulated. It's not really a threat per se.

Though it does feel that it somehow violates the primal design of bitcoin, i do believe that perhaps regulation will do good. With so much scam and negative feedbacks circulating around,  a regulation might help promote trust and confidence among investors.

Perhaps that is why there's a push for bitcoin etf. Perhaps being regulated by a governing authority in the financial industry will give it a much needed boost for stability.

Most people do not advocate regulation because they feel Bitcoin is a threat. They advocate regulation because they feel regulations can give legitimacy to bitcoin and bring in new investors. It is however important that regulation is light-touch and does not throttle innovation"

Regulation will not only help increase confidence in bitcoin as an investment, but more importantly, as a digital currency. If people started to trust bitcoin more, we could all start using it until it replaces fiat. What do you think?"

But what governments do not see is that if they do that and they get to regulate bitcoin then we're just going to abandon bitcoin and adopt another coin, so this market cannot be really destroyed by them because whatever tactic they use to destroy bitcoin or to take over it will show their hand and a developer will be able to create another coin resistant to those methods."

We all are aware with this fact that bitcoin is a decentralised crypto currency and thus there is no such proper authentic regulating body over the bitcoin who could keep eye over all the bitcoin activities and I think this weakness of bitcoin is misused by some social defaulters and they use in it some illegal activities like in selling drugs, explosives, money laundering and many more and thus in order to stop this illegal use of bitcoin, bitcoin needs to be get regulated and this could be only possible when bitcoin will get legalised all over the world."

It's just that implementing excessive rules will increase bulk reliability. In addition, too many regulations will destroy the sole purpose of decentralization.


A really sad part to lose should regulation be in place. When people took in the anatomy of bitcoin as a whole, being unregulated was among the favorite picks of early adopters.

Bitcoin was never really designed to be regulated since regulation pertains to central control. A central control that could take away a person's innate ability to transact freely. And as much as many see that government backing is quite important nowadays, bitcoin's primal design would simply go to waste at an instant should regulation takes place.

We are supposed to live in a permission-less crypto world, regulation will change all of that."

wrong. there are 3 types. bitcoin, good or decent alternative cryptocurrencies, and then shitcoins.
the shitcoins are used by traders to make profit on their bitcoins that is why you see them as ""dominated by bitcoin"" it is because people dump them immediately when they see bitcoin move.
the decent altcoins are always overshadowed by these shitcoins because the shitcoins get all the pump and dumps and hide the good coins by pushing them to the bottom of the lists.

I don't think i agree with you on some points. Not all altcoins are shitcoin, you can invest in this altcoin and make a profit to about 50%. All you need is to understand its market trading trends.

I think you can see the very clear signs of the bitcoin bubble, the market is in the long-term bearish and bitcoin prices are constantly adjusting and fluctuating very strong. You can see that after peaking at the end of 2017 bitcoin prices are constantly decreasing and fluctuating very strong. Currently bitcoin prices have fallen to $ 6400 and according to my analysis, bitcoin prices will probably continue to fall further in the near future."

That's really a thoughtful reply there hawkins. One must really set a realistic expectation given the sea of red that we have been witnessing for the past months.

Holding on to our horses and betting against all odds that another all time high will occur before the year ends will help us take rationale actions within the bitcoin land.

Different economist have different opinions about bitcoin. According to some investors it is big opportunity to gain a lot of money in a short period of time. And according to some investors it is a nothing but a big bubble. Bitcoin increasing price and profitable history attract more and more people to invest in it. Many big multinational companies start using it for their various projects and purposes and this thing help it to gain its market price.

The vast majority of people in the developed world have heard of bitcoin. That idea was reinforced this past week with the release of a survey from YouGov.

That survey indicated that 79% of Americans have heard of bitcoin. Additionally, nearly half of millennials wish to invest in bitcoin.

The online survey collected information from 2 million respondents across the United States. You can view the full study here. YouGov is an international online-based market research company headquartered in London.

Some of the most interesting facts gathered from the survey include:

- 79% of Americans are familiar with at least one kind of cryptocurrency

- 71% of Americans have heard of bitcoin

-The next-leading cryptocurrency is Ether/Ethereum, with 13% of Americans claiming they’ve heard of it

- Men are significantly more likely than women to report hearing about a cryptocurrency: 27% of women claim
 they have not heard of any cryptocurrency, while 16% of men chose the same answer

- Litecoin was the third most recognizable cryptocurrency, with 18% of men reportedly knowing about Litecoin and 5% of women

- Despite the widespread acknowledgement of bitcoin, few respondents were directly involved with the world’s largest cryptocurrency; of those who had heard of bitcoin, 87% have had no interaction with it, which means they haven’t bought, sold, or mined bitcoin

- Approximately half (49%) of respondents said they were “Glad I didn’t buy bitcoin earlier, and I don’t plan to buy it”; 15%, meanwhile, wished they “had bought bitcoin earlier, but I feel like it’s too late now”
Relatively few people have any immediate plans to buy bitcoin, according to the survey, despite the fact that over one third (36%) of respondents believe cryptocurrency will become widely accepted

- Cryptocurrencies continue to have a stigma associated with illegal transactions, with 25% of respondents claiming that they believe most cryptocurrency transactions are for illegal purposes; an additional 19% said cryptocurrencies were used equally for legal and illegal purposes, with 17% reporting that cryptocurrencies were used more for legal than illegal purposes

- Among millennials, approximately half are interested in cryptocurrency: 48% reported being interested in cryptocurrency, with 50% claiming they were not interested

- A narrow majority of respondents (57%) said they would not be interested in converting into crypto away from the US Dollar, with one third (36%) claiming they would be interested in converting the majority of their funds to cryptocurrency

Overall, this study provides one of the best views of public opinion towards cryptocurrency. With 2 million respondents, the YouGov survey was bigger than most other crypto surveys to date. You can take the survey results in an optimistic or pessimistic way. Optimists will point to the fact that 36% of respondents would be interested in switching their funds to crypto, for example, while pessimists will mention that 50% of respondents had no interest in cryptocurrency.

It’s also important to note that YouGov is an online data analytics company. That means the results are inevitably skewed towards representing people who are already on the internet. 79% of respondents reported knowing about bitcoin, for example, but those respondents are all connected to the internet. If we were to take a more representative study of America as a whole, it seems unlikely that 4 in 5 would have heard of bitcoin.

While the crypto landscape changes, we’re still a long ways away from widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies as a unit of account. This survey, however, shows that the public is interested in crypto – or at least aware of it.

A few years ago, bitcoin was a niche tech toy for nerds. Today, bitcoin has grown to become a household name.

The vast majority of people in the developed world have heard of bitcoin. That idea was reinforced this past week with the release of a survey from YouGov.

That survey indicated that 79% of Americans have heard of bitcoin. Additionally, nearly half of millennials wish to invest in bitcoin.

The online survey collected information from 2 million respondents across the United States. You can view the full study here. YouGov is an international online-based market research company headquartered in London.

Some of the most interesting facts gathered from the survey include:

- 79% of Americans are familiar with at least one kind of cryptocurrency

- 71% of Americans have heard of bitcoin

-The next-leading cryptocurrency is Ether/Ethereum, with 13% of Americans claiming they’ve heard of it

- Men are significantly more likely than women to report hearing about a cryptocurrency: 27% of women claim
 they have not heard of any cryptocurrency, while 16% of men chose the same answer

- Litecoin was the third most recognizable cryptocurrency, with 18% of men reportedly knowing about Litecoin and 5% of women

- Despite the widespread acknowledgement of bitcoin, few respondents were directly involved with the world’s largest cryptocurrency; of those who had heard of bitcoin, 87% have had no interaction with it, which means they haven’t bought, sold, or mined bitcoin

- Approximately half (49%) of respondents said they were “Glad I didn’t buy bitcoin earlier, and I don’t plan to buy it”; 15%, meanwhile, wished they “had bought bitcoin earlier, but I feel like it’s too late now”
Relatively few people have any immediate plans to buy bitcoin, according to the survey, despite the fact that over one third (36%) of respondents believe cryptocurrency will become widely accepted

- Cryptocurrencies continue to have a stigma associated with illegal transactions, with 25% of respondents claiming that they believe most cryptocurrency transactions are for illegal purposes; an additional 19% said cryptocurrencies were used equally for legal and illegal purposes, with 17% reporting that cryptocurrencies were used more for legal than illegal purposes

- Among millennials, approximately half are interested in cryptocurrency: 48% reported being interested in cryptocurrency, with 50% claiming they were not interested

- A narrow majority of respondents (57%) said they would not be interested in converting into crypto away from the US Dollar, with one third (36%) claiming they would be interested in converting the majority of their funds to cryptocurrency

Overall, this study provides one of the best views of public opinion towards cryptocurrency. With 2 million respondents, the YouGov survey was bigger than most other crypto surveys to date. You can take the survey results in an optimistic or pessimistic way. Optimists will point to the fact that 36% of respondents would be interested in switching their funds to crypto, for example, while pessimists will mention that 50% of respondents had no interest in cryptocurrency.

It’s also important to note that YouGov is an online data analytics company. That means the results are inevitably skewed towards representing people who are already on the internet. 79% of respondents reported knowing about bitcoin, for example, but those respondents are all connected to the internet. If we were to take a more representative study of America as a whole, it seems unlikely that 4 in 5 would have heard of bitcoin.

While the crypto landscape changes, we’re still a long ways away from widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies as a unit of account. This survey, however, shows that the public is interested in crypto – or at least aware of it.

The remaining 20% are probably the elderly or people in rural areas without an internet connection. I do think there is still a relatively high amount of areas in the US where you cannot get a fast, reliable broadband internet connection. What I am more interested about is finding out how many people in other countries have heard about Bitcoin. I wonder if it was as popular in other countries like it was here in America."

I'm not surprise with the number considering they have a lot of ATM that's wide spread all over their continent, 2231 machines to be exact. So with this number, its people can see it every day and so it isn't new to them. Well some might get curious and that will lead them to dig more and end up investing."

Im happy You agree. And especially I like Your idea, that everyone should be aware of all risks.

This is one risk, that enthusiasts dont like to discuss a lot: Bitcoin with decept propability, can be a monetary scheme, because service, that it is claimed to carry, may be worthless or very unreasonably priced. If this risk comes to reality, everybody, who actually paid real money for it, will lose everything.

Why I say so? because it requires only a mediocre sense of maths, one to understand, that mining of one coin is ridiculously expensive. Doesnt matter, that this money is scammed on the bill of electricity and not in dollars. Its still the same - there is no point to mine bitcoins. And if there is no point of doing so, it means product is empty... it only baseson (false) hopes and promises."

While I agree very much, that those rules apply on many assets, people have right to panic, if they have paid real money for nothing. Once again: technology may even be right (Im not saying it is, but leaving possibility open), but it still may be unreasonable use of it. As I wrote in last post: calculate what is the real cost of producing one coin? Multiply electricity and hardware costs of all miners (those who succeed and those who not) and divide it with actual number of coins released...

Yes that is a great thought. Money is not easily minted. It takes a lot of hard work to earn money and to keep it invested in lucrative options. And bitcoin is a risky investment but it fetches us lucrative returns. It has let many a people to lead an extravagant life. Also there are so many people on this forum who are routinely employed elsewhere and also doing bounties on this forum. They put a lot of hard work along with smart work and ultimately are able to get themselves a good standard of living. The market is risky because of its volatility, that shakes the confidence of so many people in the market. But they need to realise that this is the harsh reality of life in the end!

There is a huge difference, if people get rich by investing into new concept, that becomes enonourmosly successful (goole etc) or they just get rich because, they joined into fraudulent concept in early phase (most monetary schemes). If You talk about risk in that context, then yes, I agree... its very hard to guess, when You can ""invest"" if You want to make money out of scheme."

This is the reasons of these post. Bitcoin cannot ensure it's investors or users that it can give them a good profit, there is no easy ways nor risk free money as the OP says and Bitcoin is not an exception. Bitcoin is a volatile digital currency so the price is unpredictable and that is a feature of Bitcoin, it's risk is a give away even before you invest on it."

The true essense of bitcoin and it's system are not particularly in the terms of money, the real purpose of it is to have a much easiest, fastest and convenient ways of doing or making different transactions that can help to the people.

21 million coins, sorry for my bad English, I did not argue it. Im not going to prove, there can be more than 21 million coins. I asked: WHY IT IS SO?

They don't speak for Bitcoin. You still have avoided answering my question as to who you think they are.

I will tell you that that limit *could* be changed. It's only part of the protocol and if a majority of the network wanted to it could be increased. I don't think that is likely to happen.

It is however completely ludicrous to say that ""Bitcoin promised"" anything.

I know, this limit could be changed, thats what I suggested. Setting limit of 21 millions was like saying ""there is 21 tons gold to mine"", changing it would be equalt to :""no there is actually more"". Who set this limit? Definitely not ""open source crowds"".

Maybe I used bad English, bitcoin hasnt promised. Bitcoin IS a promise. A promise, that blockchain technology can be used for creating cryptocurrency. There problem lays here: while Im bad in English, my math is very good. Producing coins like this with the reasoning of creating independent anonymous, yet traceble currency, is not reasonable. If I have time tomorrow, I may give it a try and calculate for You, what is REAL production cost, that is made for producing one coin.

And whats the point of Your last sentence? We have already electronic payment, based on strong cryptography, if needed almost anonymous too. And absece of third party? That wont be granted with bitcoin too. Or how else You would call blockchainers?"

It's not only about Bitcoin but also about many different assets. People tend to buy Bitcoin even though they don't understand cryptocurrenncies or they don't even bother to read about them. People panic right now because its price is constantly decreasing without any particular reason. Don't focus on the price, focus on the technology.

And this is why bitcoin price continuously dropping,because of those people that only enters this community to make profit even if they have no idea what this is all about,what does the reason of creating this and the technology behind this

Now that the price continues to fall these people are afraid of losing and withdrawn their investmens so the demand getting lower and lower every week"

Bitcoin isn't a promise. I'm not sure if it is a language barrier or whether you just don't get that it is an open source project. It is the will of the people that use it, not a 'they' or a promise.

It has no relevance to anything. Calling 100,000,000 satoshis a coin is completely arbitrary. The cost of mining 1 satoshi is simply driven by the current market price of Bitcoin, not the other way around.

No, it means a third party like a bank that holds your money and has the power to confiscate it or reverse transactions. The blockchain is not a trusted 3rd party that can do that."

To judge if bitcoin is worth to invest in, you may consider this universal monetary rule:

There is NO good, easy, risk free money, that is available for everyone.

If the money good and risk free, it is called a heritage and it is not available for everyone.
If the money is good and available for everyone, its is called an entrepreneurship and its not risk free nor usually easy.
If the money is risk free and available for anyone, it is called a salary, but that is usually not very good.

If anyone claims, that money is good, easy, risk free and anyone can get their share of it, it is essentially a scam. Doesnt matter if You are being scammed with money, electricity or just waste of time. It also doesnt matter if there are several people who get scammed big time at once or millions, that are scammed bit by bit, it is still a scam. Any deal, where people are attracted with false promises and where the nature of their investment is kept hidden by purpose, is a scam. Bitcoin is not what promised and that fact is being disguised now.




This happened because many people are abusing bitcoin and many are using it as a scamming scheme which destroy the reputation of bitcoin."

The most important advantage of the crypto currency is the withdrawal from the state, as a monopoly on the creation of monetary assets. Do not look at the crypto as a short-term investment, the cryptocurrency has just been born, wait until it becomes strong and pushes out all other money. Then we will talk about the true price of bitcoin and what to whom when promised. By the way, what did bitcoin-boy promise you?

Yes, I think you're right. If the money are easy to have , good and not risky maybe it making sense that it will be not so important or possibly no value at all because it can have by all of us without hastle and risks. Just remember that nothing is this world is not easy to have but it will becoming easy when we are really striving for it and working on it just to have it. Thus, involving in bitcoin and it's system is not easy to do because it has a full of risk that we need to conquered therefore we can reached our success in the future."

You again attack just rather my language, than arguments.
I never said, that there will be less or more bitcoins eventually, I just asked a question: ""Why is number of bitcoins limited with 21 millions?"" Then You guys started to ask me to tell where I take it from. I then found several articles from decent sites, that backed it up. That 21 millions on the other hand, came as an answer to empty argument, that Bitcoin hasnt promised anything. It has. Or its creator. Whatever. Keeping number of Bitcoins at 21 millions is a promise.

I also never said, miners are creating price. Miners are gamblers, who invest more, that coin is worth into digging one. That is of course an average, same as buying a lottery ticket.

And last, I definitely didnt say, p2p cant be done. I told, that they are existing already, Bitcoin has nothing to add, that has a value. Definitely not so large, that it would be reasoned, why their mining is so expensive.

Overall: this discussion here reminds me very well one other situation, when I helped to expose KairosPlanet on different site. Those enthusiasts too always attacked language (Im agree, its not the best, English is my 3rd language) and refused to face the reality:

1) Why was number of coins limited with 21 millions?
2) why is getting coins so expensive, so its above all normalities? (collective usage of power to mine them)
3) what has bitcoin to offer additional to, say PayPal, that makes it so expensive?

Cryptocurrency is nothing else, than playing on crowd's average stupidity, just like KairosPlanet. In latter case people didint understand, why its not reasonable rent hard disc at ridiculous cost, doesnt matter if it was in cloud or was divided into countless of fragments and therefore perfectly safe. which was bullsh*t obviously. You too have understood some few concepts of currency and crypto, and keep coming back to them in every answer. In reality its a monetary scheme."

How about you stop looking at Bitcoin as an ""investment"" for a second?




Im not gonna stop for long on my 17 posts, lets just say, Im ill at home and this topic is interesting for me?

21 million coins, sorry for my bad English, I did not argue it. Im not going to prove, there can be more than 21 million coins. I asked: WHY IT IS SO?

But what I did like a lot, was Your last suggestion. OK, I stop looking at bitcoin as an investment. I want to buy something decentralized. Where I get coin for that? Whats the price of coin? Will I get 5000 eur worth car for 1 Bitcoin?

Investment is risky, the truth about Bitcoin, it is the most stable crypto among all the ALT coins posted. Yes, the price value may goes up and goes down dependent on the volume of investment put in for Bitcoin at any given time during the market trading, Bitcoin has been proven to have good fundamentals, support system in placed.

To judge if bitcoin is worth to invest in, you may consider this universal monetary rule:

There is NO good, easy, risk free money, that is available for everyone.

If the money good and risk free, it is called a heritage and it is not available for everyone.
If the money is good and available for everyone, its is called an entrepreneurship and its not risk free nor usually easy.
If the money is risk free and available for anyone, it is called a salary, but that is usually not very good.

If anyone claims, that money is good, easy, risk free and anyone can get their share of it, it is essentially a scam. Doesnt matter if You are being scammed with money, electricity or just waste of time. It also doesnt matter if there are several people who get scammed big time at once or millions, that are scammed bit by bit, it is still a scam. Any deal, where people are attracted with false promises and where the nature of their investment is kept hidden by purpose, is a scam. Bitcoin is not what promised and that fact is being disguised now.

One of the truth about bitcoin is the bitcoin is really exist but the only thing why others try to dispute it because they don't believe it that there is a money through online and that's why some people are trying to use it for ""scam"" purposes so that they can benefit of it and with that process is through investing. It is just the matter of believing it and time that bitcoin is really exist. We all know that there is no easy way to have an income that's why you need to risk it whether the outcome would be a failure or successful."

Bitcoin transactions are recorded in an electronic ledger with the blockchain technology. The features are found useful and trustworthy so its popularity has been spread world wide and more people are attracted and, hence I am also attracted to join with Bitcoin community.
That is right, what I really love about it as well is the tendency and ability that it would change the world someday, and we are aiming for it that one day bitcoin will fully adopt by all people in the world."

To judge if bitcoin is worth to invest in, you may consider this universal monetary rule:

There is NO good, easy, risk free money, that is available for everyone.

If the money good and risk free, it is called a heritage and it is not available for everyone.
If the money is good and available for everyone, its is called an entrepreneurship and its not risk free nor usually easy.
If the money is risk free and available for anyone, it is called a salary, but that is usually not very good.

If anyone claims, that money is good, easy, risk free and anyone can get their share of it, it is essentially a scam. Doesnt matter if You are being scammed with money, electricity or just waste of time. It also doesnt matter if there are several people who get scammed big time at once or millions, that are scammed bit by bit, it is still a scam. Any deal, where people are attracted with false promises and where the nature of their investment is kept hidden by purpose, is a scam. Bitcoin is not what promised and that fact is being disguised now.



What does it mean: ""Bitcoin is not what you promised"" What to you and who can promise? It is clear that money or coins will not appear for you just like that, and they need to be earned. We should seize the opportunity and rejoice that we live in the era of the development of the crypto currency."

You just said it all, if there is no risk then it's not money. No money is ever risk free, remove risk then it's not money again. The ability for us to succeed is to study it very well though some will always argue that if it's risky then it's not worth it. Even acquiring fiat have its own risk that is what some fail to see. No risk no reward.

True. I share this notion also.
What applies to money/investment also applies to Bitcoin too, except that Bitcoin or alternative currencies are not being controlled by government or a central power."

Bitcoin is worth investing because if you invest in bitcoin you will also benefit very much from bitcoin and it is true that bitcoin is an investment that has a fairly large risk but if you believe in bitcoin you will definitely benefit from bitcoin in just how many years so we have to believe in bitcoin, if we want to benefit from bitcoin, and if bitcoin is an illegal investment why until now everyone still uses bitcoin as their investment to get money quickly so I think bitcoin is not too risky so we don't need worried

That is right, besides the fact that we can invest in bitcoin there are also a lot of advantage it brings in our life just like the payment system, nowadays there is no hassle in the payment system, and we can remit money and every time we want, and we can also make money  by just simply investing in it and by using our skills."

To judge if bitcoin is worth to invest in, you may consider this universal monetary rule:

There is NO good, easy, risk free money, that is available for everyone.

If the money good and risk free, it is called a heritage and it is not available for everyone.
If the money is good and available for everyone, its is called an entrepreneurship and its not risk free nor usually easy.
If the money is risk free and available for anyone, it is called a salary, but that is usually not very good.

If anyone claims, that money is good, easy, risk free and anyone can get their share of it, it is essentially a scam. Doesnt matter if You are being scammed with money, electricity or just waste of time. It also doesnt matter if there are several people who get scammed big time at once or millions, that are scammed bit by bit, it is still a scam. Any deal, where people are attracted with false promises and where the nature of their investment is kept hidden by purpose, is a scam.

What you write about is fair for all ways of making money. I mean, believing in stability in our world is self-deception. Even the inheritance can depreciate due to inflation, the business can cease to be profitable, one can be fired from work (or can be replaced by a robot)).
Crypto currents frighten people, because it is something completely new, but if you think about it, it's the only way that humanity has always developed. All new technologies were perceived ambiguously or negatively.
All that you should always remember - before you start investing in bitcoin, do not forget about the risks. A common rule for all investors is not to buy bitcoin for the last money. In case there was a collapse in the market and the military-technical cooperation fell in price - do not sell all the currency for a pittance. Try to store bitcoin until the course grows."

On the other hand, nothing is being covered up in bitcoin. Nothing is working ""behind the shadows"". Everyone can see the transaction history. I really don't think that all that you are claiming was never claimed by bitcoin at all.

1. ""Money is good"". It is good if you know how to trade or if you are lucky. It is good if you have skills that you can offer on the Internet and get paid for it with bitcoins. Money is good on the Internet, even if you're not going to get paid in bitcoin, because your clients are mostly from first world countries.
2. ""Easy"". It is only easy if you know EXACTLY what you are doing. But when you're just starting out, it's not really easy at all. It's also the reason why only the hardworkers are the one that are at the top right now. It's not easy but it certainly does become easy over time.
3. ""Risk free"". I honestly don't know how can you think that bitcoin is risk-free when everyone's shouting that bitcoin is really risky because of its high volatility.
4. ""Anyone can get their share of it."". Anyone can indeed receive bitcoins but why would someone give them bitcoins? You are getting your share only if you mine, work in exchange of bitcoins, or buy them. It's not like bitcoin was released to the public and everyone can just get as much as they can. You have to either mine it or buy (or work in exchanged of) the mined ones.

To judge if bitcoin is worth to invest in, you may consider this universal monetary rule:

There is NO good, easy, risk free money, that is available for everyone.

If the money good and risk free, it is called a heritage and it is not available for everyone.
If the money is good and available for everyone, its is called an entrepreneurship and its not risk free nor usually easy.
If the money is risk free and available for anyone, it is called a salary, but that is usually not very good.

If anyone claims, that money is good, easy, risk free and anyone can get their share of it, it is essentially a scam. Doesnt matter if You are being scammed with money, electricity or just waste of time. It also doesnt matter if there are several people who get scammed big time at once or millions, that are scammed bit by bit, it is still a scam. Any deal, where people are attracted with false promises and where the nature of their investment is kept hidden by purpose, is a scam.

And to decide things like that does take time, but when compared to the way people get profit aside from cryptocurrency it is more convenient.

You are wrong. ""Continuous improvement"" is just bla-bla-blah, to give BTC a bit more time to live. Thats very similar to many othes schemes. You will be introduced with Schnorr signatures, MAST, Lightning network, etc...

Except, none of these wont work. BTC will keep its price more or less as long as there is a hope for a miracle technology, that comes and solves scalability issue. Lets leave everything else aside for now, including question, whether BTC is needed as product at all, and focus on solving scalability issue only. IT WONT HAPPEN.

This is perfect sample of ""risk assessement"", that leads to unavoidable bankrupcy at some day.

Not the biggest risk takers are rewarded the most! Far from that! Mainly early whales and some very good speculants earn well with BTC. Regular buyer plays with luck with poor odds. As people who have stock background, have an advantage, when speculating if BTC goes up or down, they are ready to play along that game.

If BTC core technology and especially its scalability ever went under SERIOUS investogation, it would become all clear, that this is a financial scheme, not more. Those who have early supply of many BTC, run huge profits now, those who mine and those who buy now at market price, they just gamble, not more. "

Very good. This precisely is the whole point of my topic. I want people to come to that statement, as You wrote in last sentence.

I indeed think, that BTC is just a tool for scamming. As it became so ridiculosly popular, some late joiners (besides whales) can make good money in it too, by guessing, how BTC price will change. Eventually it becomes obvious, that BTC is not viable as product (currency) and it will lose most of its price, maybe all. It´s a scam, maybe not designed to be, but that wont matter in future."

Thats unfortunately impossible question. You are asking me to tell You, how coin flip will result.

What the future will be like, that i can answer. Most probably BTC will bounce few times, every peak ending at lower than previous and is followed by deeper and deeper fall.

No, You are wrong. There is no healthy reason to believe, BTC stock price will go up. Its fully irrational. If BTC doesnt solve scalability/efficiency issues, it will not even become a product and there is absolutely no reason to believe, its value will grow.

In my own opinion: those issues are unsolvable and creators of BTC know it. That would make BTC the biggest SCAM and monetary scheme in human history."

If the money good and risk free, it is called a heritage and it is not available for everyone.
If the money is good and available for everyone, its is called an entrepreneurship and its not risk free nor usually easy.
If the money is risk free and available for anyone, it is called a salary, but that is usually not very good.

Doesnt matter if You are being scammed with money, electricity or just waste of time.

As the old adage goes, any investment is not for the faint hearted, it requires bravery and a lot of risking so to say.

Unfortunately, even the most risky person you get to know may not have enough asset to make an investment (a supplementary truth to your universal money rule). Thus, boiling it down to the truth that investment is not for everyone, it is for the wealthy and the risky, combined.

You will see a lot of genuinely concerned people fend off investment goals  of those who does not have enough, have only enough and have more than enough but no knowledgeable on the economics of crypto.

And as you tipped the iceberg of scam, the shinier the promises of return on investment with bitcoin, the bigger the problem that could be lying down beneath such promise which usually causes a damaging collision.

Thats not a correct statement. Bitcoin promised, there will be no more than 21 million coins. I suppose You do understand the meaning of this?

They also have made many promises on their product´s characteristics.
There was no promise to begin with. Bitcoin was not created as an asset or a commodity to invest in. It was created to become an alternative mode or means of payment. A monetary innovation wherein governments and banks have no control over it. Digital currencies were created with a fixed quantity. Hence, $21M is Bitcoin's number.

BTC doesnt need specifically ""hide"" anything. The concept is complicated enough, that 95% of people dont understand it to the core.

No, my friend, there is A HUGE fundamental difference. Netflix is a new technology, proven to have working a product behind, having growing user base, understandable potential for growth, understandable income mechanism etc.

BTC is not a new useful technology, it is just CLAIMED to become a new technology after scalability problem is solved. Now, read this very carefully: many IT people think, that this problem CAN NOT be solved in a way, that BTC remains uncentralized and used a reasonable amount of ressources.

To judge if bitcoin is worth to invest in, you may consider this universal monetary rule:

There is NO good, easy, risk free money, that is available for everyone.

If the money good and risk free, it is called a heritage and it is not available for everyone.
If the money is good and available for everyone, its is called an entrepreneurship and its not risk free nor usually easy.
If the money is risk free and available for anyone, it is called a salary, but that is usually not very good.

If anyone claims, that money is good, easy, risk free and anyone can get their share of it, it is essentially a scam. Doesnt matter if You are being scammed with money, electricity or just waste of time. It also doesnt matter if there are several people who get scammed big time at once or millions, that are scammed bit by bit, it is still a scam. Any deal, where people are attracted with false promises and where the nature of their investment is kept hidden by purpose, is a scam. Bitcoin is not what promised and that fact is being disguised now.




I dont think bitcoin promise anything, it just provide a medium to transfer money in a decentralized way,the price is derived on how useful is it, that is all

A limitation with 21M coins is a promise of its scarcity.
A halvening payment for solved blockchain is a promise of payment.
Outsourcing transfer validation, to keep this process 3rd party and non-centralized same time, is a promise."

yup, you need to face the risk if you want to earn here in the crypto world. Even if there’s risk in investing in bitcoin there’s still a good side of it,there’s so many benefits investing in bitcoin, one of the main benefits is that there are no transaction costs and taxes involved. The transactions made, whether online or through a mobile device, cannot be traced back to the user. Obviously, since this is not a paper currency, bitcoins cannot be stolen unless someone gains an unauthorized access to your computer."

By so far, You can not earn anything organical with BTC. Only way, You can ""earn"" is from someone other´s behalf. And those who buy from You, can not earn anything either by any other means, than selling with more, than the bought.

What You speak about dreams is mathematically impossible for wider audience, until BTC will have a viable product/service behind it. Which in my opinion will happen NEVER."

Bitcoin is not what promised and that fact is being disguised now.

Well, oddly enough, Bitcoin is hard to explain to someone who is brainwashed to think that only fiat currencies, national currencies like USD can be used for payment, trading and storing values.

Before there was a fiat, people used the commodity-based money, so everyone knew what gave it value, which is the work invested to extract this commodity. For example, gold represents the work invested to mine it.

So, that way, Bitcoin has value because it represents the work invested to make it. In particular, in the case of bitcoin, it is an effort invested in securing bitcoin transactions. Yes. Bitcoin transactions are valuable and people work to make more of them.

There is no question why money has value or not !? Why do people believe it's a good idea !?

Fiat currency = credit, promise to work or force others to work in the future. Fiat's currency is inherently unstable because only having value during the promotion of the issuing entity is still considered credible. If there is a doubt that certain countries will not be able to effectively force people to work to get currencies to pay taxes, the currency will collapse."

I wonder what would happen to a nation if they were well-educated about the matter instead. If everyone knew about the Nixon Shock, would we be treating fiat money the same? Fiat money is nothing but paper. The only ""work"" that was done to make such is just the printing itself which is, obviously, quite easy that others managed to print fake paper money themselves.

Would people be storing their wealth in the form of money? Or would it be in other (and better) form such as gold, or bitcoin? With the current situation with the inflation these days, it's even better to take a chance and risk your fiat in investing in something as volatile as bitcoin.

The feedback that they have received are from the people who are in this market before the pump. That means those are the people that were able to ride that massive pump and made some fortune from it. Apparently, others thought that they are going to be experiencing the same thing when in reality, it only happens once in a while. Now that we're down from the peak, the newcomers are panicking as this is not what they thought things would turn out. They are all thinking that the person introduced bitcoin to them is making money while they aren't. We'd be lucky to experience another massive pump soon although there's no sign of that happening at all especially now that crypto's image (in general) is going down because of the surge in scam ICOs."

And i'm with you on that vfrcbv911.  My appreciation of bitcoin is not only limited with its profitable potentials, but with the strong ideologies it is packed with. The permission-less aspect. The Pseudonymity. It's purposeful GDP design and coin supply ceiling. The halvings and epochs. All these are financial marvel that brings back financial prowess to users.

Truly, more than earning, bitcoin gave us so much more to be thankful for."

I doubt very much about bitcoin's future, but according to my analysis, in the long run, bitcoin prices are in the bearish cycle, you can see that the market is falling sharply during the last few hours and that is the price. of altcoin are falling amnhj under, so I believe that at this point you should only invest short and trade on bitcoin."

I can see AML BitCoin as the next bitcoin in the near future. The value of the AML Bitcoin is not determined by any government. Therefore, if any economic or financial instability occurs, AML Bitcoin users are not affected.
Yeah, there are many opinions about bitcoin. They said it will last long because it is already part of our modern generation. They said also that it will not last because it is not a fiat. But for me i think it will last."

Bitcoin was never designed to be a speculative asset, it was designed to be a currency. Even here many (most) of you are treating it as an investment. Many of you think it's dying because the price is dropping. Well, if that's how you define Bitcoin, you may very well loose your shirts, or become filthy rich if you're wrong but, you still won't understand Bitcoin.

Bitcoin was created and designed to free the world from the monetary oppression of governments and banks controlling the money supply and keeping people in poverty or close to it, as a means of controlling the population and making the 1% richer off the labor of the rest of us. Bitcoin answers to no central power,  Bitcoin can be used as money, in nations or, between friends. Outside the infrastructure we have created and the mega markets and exchanges, it's true value is what two or more people decide it is and that is the beauty of Bitcoin. Because of this, it will never ""die"" but will always have a purpose no matter what value the world assigns to it on any given day.

I doubt very much about bitcoin's future, but according to my analysis, in the long run, bitcoin prices are in the bearish cycle, you can see that the market is falling sharply during the last few hours and that is the price. of altcoin are falling amnhj under, so I believe that at this point you should only invest short and trade on bitcoin.

Bitcoin is hard to survive long without government approval. When Bitcoin is widely accepted and used, it will certainly increase in price and keep it stable. Over and above, blockchain technology has evolved, needs virtual currency to make, and of course Bitcoin will be very useful in the tech world.
Because of the presence of Blockchain technology crypto currency and bitcoin has a better future, in a sense that iis adopted globally, even if someone government don't recognize it but for those countries who patronizing it would have better effects that is it becomes a phenomena.
I think, after a long time experiencing descent at market prices. the future of bitcoin will be beautiful. we just wait and enjoy the results."

No it's not at all dependent on fiat, also bitcoins is valued in all currencies not only dollars, this has been done so people know the exact value of their trade. While it's pertinent to point that dollars are a universally accepted to value goods and services, and hence bitcoins is measured in value of dollars.

 It seems to me you're mistaken that we live in the Stone Age times, where we could have exchanged bitcoins directly and value it in satoshis, do you have any idea how much time that would consume, plus how would you value your earnings?

Bitcoins is independent of fiat and same goes for fiat, they're only used to ease the transaction and save time for all, and most importantly make people realise the value of their trade."

It is not really the most popular currency but it is the most traded fiat currency that is why Bitcoin's common value of fiat currency is US Dollar, also not because it is convenient.

There can also be a reverse comparison and we can say how much the dollar costs in the amount of bitcoin. This is acceptable, because both the dollar and bitcoin have a cost function.

Exactly. If bitcoins are decentralized and a currency itself then how can it depend on any other type of currency and why should it?

well, the truth is that we need something to compare it with, in case you are not aware the USD is compared against things like gold or crude oil in some case without those comparisons we can't make sense of bitcoin. so without gold or crude oil did you honestly think other nations will gladly accept the dollar for international trade"

that doesn't mean it relies on fiat. would you like us to go back a thousand years and measure value of things like bitcoin in goods? like saying 50000 satoshi is equal to 1 chicken?
Yes good answer I think! every nations have their own fiat currency and always products considering by fiat currency.

Actually I've made that argument before. I'd buy that chicken for 50k sats! As long as it's cooked rotisserie chicken. It's a really good deal. I'd personally sell chicken for 125k sats.

Bitcoin is not valuated on dollars. USD is merely a marker for us to easily understand bitcoin's worth.

You see, bitcoin is the one who dictates how much it is worth in US Dollars and not the opposite where USD dictates how much bitcoin it is. The USD can never dictate the ratio.

Last year's all time high of bitcoin even proves how independent it is. While the buying power of USD declines over the same season, the buying power of bitcoin grew tremendously in size. If bitcoin was actually dependent on fiat currency (and in this case the USD), bitcoin can never grow strength while USD is weakening. Would you not agree?"

I suggest you read this, Tim Swanson wrote the! Why Bitcoin Needs Fiat (And This Won't Change in 2018)



Tim Swanson is the director of research at Post Oak Labs, a U.S.-based technology advisory firm, and the former director of research at distributed ledger technology consortium R3.
Imagine a parallel universe in which the U.S. economy could only grow at $50 every 10 minutes generating a mere $2.6 million of output per annum. That due to a hard-coded economic planning computer program, every four years the income its inhabitants collectively generated divided in half. Such that in year nine, its output shrank and was $12.50 every 10 minutes or $657,000 a year.

That is to say, irrespective of how productive and skilled the labor force became or how large the labor force grew, the productive output in the U.S remained fixed and static with the only change (downward in this case) occurring just once every four years.

How many people would volunteer to live and work in that ""Upside Down"" world?

This situation effectively mirrors the static, internal economy of bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies.

For instance, with proof-of-work networks like bitcoin, the marginal productivity of labor is zero. It does not matter how many more units of labor are added to the income generation (mining) process as the network will always produce the same amount of economic output.

Today, after nearly nine years of operation, the bitcoin network – better referred to as Bitcoinland – generates 12.5 bitcoins roughly every 10 minutes. Irrespective of external economic conditions, of demand, the Bitcoinland economy will generate about 657,000 bitcoins per year in its third epoch.

While comparisons with aggregate measurements like GDP and money supplies may be an imperfect analogy, the fact that economic expansion as measured in output can – with the exception of a fork and rule change – never change in bitcoin due to its inelastic coin supply is arguably detrimental to its unit of account.

The purposefully planned sameness is often extolled as a ""feature not a bug,"" and many cryptocurrency enthusiasts like to daydream for when regulators and financial institutions of our own world disappear, eaten up by grey goo nanites funded by bitcoins.

But before bitcoiners can reach their Upside Down nirvana state, they need to resolve the underlying omnipresent economic calculation challenge facing their security system and labor force.

The phenomenon is simple to describe: virtually no participant in Bitcoinland conducts economic calculations (such as pricing) for any goods or services in cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin.  There are many reasons for this, including chronic volatility.


ncreasingly high ($10+) transaction fees that result in hemorrhaging of merchants (even their very own Cobra Commander acknowledges this issue).


Labor force
If Bitcoinland is viewed as its own sovereign (virtual) nation-state, the only wages any native participant receives in return for any kind of service rendered is what miners are paid to solve and ""vote"" on a benign problem about once every 10 minutes.

From the perspective of the network: developers, maintainers, administrators, enthusiasts, Twitter sock puppets, meme artisans, flame war veterans, self-appointed thought leaders, pumpers, hat wearers, etc., are all viewed as foreign third parties and can only receive bitcoins after they are first minted by the miners.

Much like multinational corporations (MNC) with large overseas operations, miners of cryptocurrency networks as a whole do not measure the income they receive in terms of bitcoins (or other discrete cryptocurrencies), but instead they measure their income in terms of ""fiat"" from foreign financial markets, specifically converting bitcoins into the local fiat currency where their mining operation physically resides.

However, unlike MNCs that eventually repatriate some or all of their capital back to their headquarters, aside from a recycling of coins into ICOs, most cryptocurrency-focused companies are still dependent on what amounts to foreign domestic income (FDI), regular injections of foreign capital from venture firms in order to grow or even measure enterprise valuations.

Miners do this because the unit of account for fiat currency is typically stable and liquid, such that they can pay wages to their employees, pay rent, electrical costs, property taxes, etc. There are exceptions to stability, such as planned economies of Venezuela and Zimbabwe which have suffered from years of political chaos, but in general, most developed countries and even developing countries have relatively stable domestic currencies relative to Bitcoinland.

And because bitcoin is still not used as a unit of account, its labor force (miners), rely on a third-party reference data in order to conduct all economic calculations.  That is to say, in order for Bob the miner to accurately calculate if he should increase or decrease consumption (and investment) of capital, or to measure whether his mining operation is profitable, Bob projects future revenue based on a unit of account that is stable, in this case, currency from foreign capital markets.

During the Cold War there was a joke in academia: that the Soviet Union would conquer the world with the exception of New Zealand (other versions used Switzerland as the cut-out). New Zealand would be left alone because the Politburo needed a functioning market so that the Soviets could know what the market prices were for goods and services.

While Bitcoinland may be attracting large sums of foreign capital, miners continually still need very liquid over-the-counter (OTC) and spot exchanges denominated in foreign currencies because it is with these foreign currencies that they pay their bills.

In this case, despite their own defects and problems, the U.S., eurozone, Japan, South Korea, China and several other countries effectively stand in for ""New Zealand,"" such that the national currencies and prices in these countries reflect dynamic economic conditions that bitcoin miners can use as reference rates in their capital consumption projections.

Final remarks
In 2018, just as the past nine years, miners will still depend on foreign financial markets for both stable pricing and liquidity. If the existing traditional financial markets became chaotic and unstable, miners would be unable to rationally plan and allocate for future investments.

For instance, the unseen costs of hash generation for a hypothetically stable $20,000 bitcoin would be about $13 billion in capital consumed by miners in their rent-seeking race.

And that is just one proof-of-work coin. If there were dramatic bouts of volatility, or even an extended bear market, this could result in bankruptcies like CoinTerra, HashFast or KnC previously went through, though that is beyond the speculation of this article.

Ironically, despite all the bluster, because cryptocurrency ecosystems lack a circular flow of income, they will still be dependent on the very financial system they vilify for daily support and stability.

And while there have been many ""stablecoin"" projects announced and launched over the past year, nearly all of them are not only dependent on commercial bank accounts, but also on the economic stability of a specific economic region they aim to serve. Guess what set of entities provides that type of relative stability?

Ideological enthusiasts will likely resort to whataboutisms and respond by bitcoinsplaining: how dirty filthy statists will censor your virtuous darknet market transactions and that maintaining proof-of-work networks is worth any cost to the environment! But again, that is for a snarky article on a different day.

Empirically with proof-of-work-based blockchains, the labor force and the liquidity providers all still depend on functional, mature foreign capital markets in order to convert their coins into real money. Perhaps this will change as more hedging products, courtesy again of foreign financial markets, are brought online.

While the traditional financial markets will continue to exist and grow without having to rely on cryptocurrencies for rationally pricing domestic economic activity, in 2018, as in years prior, Bitcoinland is still fully dependent on the stability of foreign economies providing liquidity and pricing data to the endogenous labor force of bitcoin.

Dollar is not the ""leading Fiat currency"" in the world, USD is just a fiat that is mostly used on trading the reason most of the values and prices of crypto currencies are based on USD.

The mode of purchase of bitcoin is currently based on three:

2. Altcoins of which mainly is Ethereum.

Now considering the money coming in from these two sources, every market price of bitcoin will be based on the currency used to purchase the coins.

As I think, it’s not really exact to say that bitcoin depends on fiat. First up, we should mention to the means of cryptocurrency and fiat, both of them are quite different. Bitcoin is developed by advanced technology. Probably, because fiat money appear sooner than digital currency, thus fiat is considered as an basic unit so that cryptocurrency or bitcoin can be realized about the value. In conclusion,both currencies have a slight relation in some cases. Two kinds of currencies are quite independent. Because bitcoin can develop without fiat and so does fiat."

We all know that bitcoin is a decentralised crypto currency and thus there is no such proper authentic regulating body who could keep eye over all the bitcoin activities so bitcoin is completely a independent currency in itself and as there is no such governing body over bitcoin therefore sometimes it is being use for many illegal activities but still bitcoin is many times better than Fiat currencies and instead of depending on Fiat, bitcoin is threat to these Fiat currencies.
Yes I agree on that, I believe that bitcoin is really independent anyone can use bitcoin any country can use it and any individual can also use it. I believe that there is no company that holds bitcoin it depends upon the volume of investors it is not depends on country or anything. So totally agree that it is an independent currency.
I also agree with this. Bitcoin has its own sovereignty but it is shown with dollar. It is like a company having the company's face rather than its CEO. With this kind the bitcoin will be more known and understand well. It does not depend because dependence deals with cannot stand alone with it. Fiat is just the representation for bitcoin."

That is just the price of bitcoin as per the fiat vs bitcoin trades happening in the market. It does not give any sort of inference that so much bitcoin is backed by so much fiat. Because that is not the case. Bitcoin itself is independent but for monetary and trading purposes we need to set a market capitalization and a price for common people to buy/sell it as an asset.

Exactly Dudeperfect. Bitcoin can be denoted using any valuable assets but complicated computations might not work out easily.

Moreover, the dependence of valuation will perhaps remain till the day we see bitcoin to be as liquid as fiat. That said dependence will only diminish as bitcoin becomes widely accepted as payment for virtually everything and anything. When we are able to use bitcoin itself to pay for electricity, water and other utility bills. When you can go pick up your grocery and pay with your bitcoin wallet alone. When school canteens will accept our children's daily school allowance in bitcoin. Perhaps then, and only then, the fiat dependency will go away."

You can't drop $1M worth of bitcoins in the market without heavily fluctuating the price (and maybe even creating a panic sell). Also bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies market, in general) is still sensitive to bad news, regulations, tax laws, FUD, etc—most markets are.

And how are you planning to achieve that? Because for that to happen you will need to stop freedom of speech and I do not know about you but I invested in bitcoin because I believe in freedom and want to have a currency that is not regulated by the government, so what makes you think that many people will agree with your solution of stopping freedom of speech just to stop the volatility of the market?"

criticism is not the reason for volatility which means removing it won't change anything about volatility of bitcoin. the reason for that is the fact that the market is still pretty small despite how much it has grown, the market being the exchanges. this is partly because of exchanges not being regulated and mostly being risky places to use but also it is because bitcoin is new and has not yet grown enough to have a big and mature market."

I do not think so, the criticism of Bitcoin does not affect the price. Bitcoin's pricing is determined by its holders, in accordance with the supply-demand rules, in accordance with the rise of the flat coin, and a number of other factors.

bitcoin price is volatile only because of the way its market is.  for example if you compare the bitcoin exchange order books with some major asset order book you can see a big sell off of bitcoin can change the price a lot more than the same size sell off can change the price of that major asset with packer books.

I wouldnt agree that bitcoin is fragile if anything it is quite resilient through
all that has been thrown at it in a very short space of time.

Indeed. There is no escaping criticism. And what's more? Any flourishing industry will receive tons of it. Some do it to bring the market down and some do it with constructive purposes.

Therefore, criticism should always be welcomed with an open mind. If the point in hand is valid and calls for improvement, then it serves as a bright reminder and call to action.

volatility is what makes bitcoin price go up or down. Without it ,bitcoin would not have reached 20 000 us dollars last year. Therr are many factors that affect bitcoin's price and we cannot actually make a way to stop it. If bitcoin's price became consistent, meaning there will be less ups and downs, probably there were less investors than before because volatility is what makes profit for them."

The government cannot do this. there is no backdoor in Bitcoin or no way for them to control the network unless they had 51% of the hashrate, which is incredibly unlikely due to the cost of production of ASICs and the limited resources available. The government would have to crack down on their citizens and restrict their freedoms in order to control the network by making mining illegal (think new world order type stuff), and we would have much bigger problems if this were to happen. And if they were to do this the only thing they could do is to not accept certain transactions into a block. They wouldn't be able to do much more than that.

This scenario is so infeasible it's not worth worrying about."

Bitcoin's network simply can't be controlled by governments due to its decentralised nature.

If bitcoin is officially recognised by the government, then it is only on a legal sense. For example, they may recognise bitcoin as a currency, which may have potential tax implications. Another term for this process would be legalisation.

However, it does not mean all of a sudden that bitcoin transactions will be able to be controlled and verified by governments after this process of legalisation. Because whatever recognition bitcoin gets from the government is only applicable for the government/taxation agencies, and has no effect on the network itself."

3199;2018-09-12 12:21:29;bocah cilik;Jr. Member;53;0;If the government issues official permits for Bitcoin, that will be the main policy they will make. But I feel that it is impossible to happen right now, because there are still countries that prohibit Bitcoin from entering.
3200;2018-09-12 12:26:07;Shubhamgill33;Jr. Member;56;0;Yes Bitcoin is an independent crypto currency that has got mass attention from investors worldwide and has been really successful. Whether or not Governments allow Bitcoin to operate, it will be interesting to see they regulate bitcoin or not. Governments will try to regulate bitcoin since it can be used for both legal as well as illegal payments.
3201;2018-09-12 12:31:55;ShowOffoN;Jr. Member;56;0;I don't think that the government will meddle with Bitcoin. For one, they don't have the technology and systems to run it. Besides, Bitcoin and other currency are meant to be independent and should not be governed by any entity or body. Can you imagine how messy it could be if the government steps in and include their political agenda? No way man!

I second that. Government wouldn't be meddling with stuff it can't control."
3203;2018-09-12 12:59:36;CrazeCoinz;Member;294;10;The only thing can a government do is to provide a regulations in investing cryptocurrency but not to change or manage the transaction of any users. They can't change the blockchain and therefore they can't take advantage of their power. I think this is also the reason why some countries had not given any supports on bitcoin as a currency.

Making Bitcoin legal and mix in managing transaction are both different. Mix in managing transactions means government are taking control over bitcoin network and they are going to manage transaction which is not possible as it is not controlled by anyone. And if that is happening then the value and usage of bitcoin will become worthless and it will destroy the bitcoin main aim."

When accepted by the government, Bitcoin must accept government-issued laws, which are unavoidable. Even user management is no exception."

3210;2018-09-12 13:32:44;gellany32;Newbie;26;0;actually there are certain government that has already accepted cryptocurrency under their jurisdiction so the acceptance of cryptocurrency will depend upon the government in each country.

However, it has its downside, that when it is accepted by the government, Bitcoin must accept the rules from the Government. Maybe some government regulation will make Bitcoin lose its great capabilities."
3212;2018-09-12 13:43:15;alroys;Jr. Member;252;1;Bitcoin is decentralized, and the government cannot interfere in this matter. Bitcoin transactions differ greatly from banks that can be regulated by the government. the government's duty is to give permission, and legalize Bitcoin as a legitimate payment tool, so that Bitcoin users become calm and comfortable. and I'm sure, if a government legalizes Bitcoin as a legitimate means of payment, then the demand for bitcoin from the people in that country will increase rapidly.

The second one was bitcoin was not connected to any government agency or bitcoin is not handle of any government officials so it means they can't mixes it and as i think bitcoin is stand alone or no one can manipulate the value.
3216;2018-09-12 13:57:43;tuturutmunding;Jr. Member;98;0;maybe bitcoin will be a legitimate payment instrument. if it can happen, of course it will have a positive effect on the price spike, there will be more adoption of bitcoin and more mining will also demand the bitcoin market will be the most valuable asset

To be frank, government will not even look after the transactions because it will be highly regulated by the private industries and giant mining firms and much more miscellaneous organisations.

But, government will benefit from one important thing and that is the taxes that will be taken over the crypto to fiat conversions. And yes this will be the medium for government officials to take the opportunity of ruling the crypto space."

Bitcoin decentralized natures won't sustain any centralized behavioral. Governments only able to regulate Bitcoin only from the outside, not within the network of Bitcoin itself.
